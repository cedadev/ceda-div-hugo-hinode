This will be a hugely important dataset, bringing together a unique time-series of observations needed to address current scientific challenges. The archive will hold over 80TB of data, spanning 15 years. Data products will gradually become available from March 2006, and the entire archive is due to be complete in August 2007\nFor further information see the AATSR Fact Sheet."

In addition, the MODIS instrument will be used as an example for retrieving surface properties. Teaching will consist of four sets of core lectures which will focus on atmospheric fundamentals, the inverse problem, atmospheric dynamics and atmospheric composition. Also, there will be guest lectures concentrating on specific AURA instruments (HIRDLS, OMI, MLS and TES) as well as an opening talk from a NASA representative who will give an overview of the AURA mission.\nThe Spring School was set up in 1999 with the aim of giving anyone with a degree in mathematics or physical sciences a concise but reasonably thorough introduction to the inverse problem as it applies to Earth Observation.\nFurther Information and application details"

        content: "Last week, we had the pleasure of hosting a Year 12 work experience student, Katherine, within the CEDA team. She wrote us a blog post, take a look below to see what she got up to\u0026hellip; \u0026nbsp; My name is Katherine Nutt, I am 17 and I go to Blessed George Napier School in Banbury. I study A Level Biology, Physics and Maths and am also doing an EPQ titled “Why are there so few women in STEM?” After 6th form, I would like to go to university to study Civil Engineering, and I ultimately want to become a chartered engineer.\nI applied for this work experience placement many months ago when I was still uncertain as to what I would like to study after 6th form. I was really pleased when I got a placement in the RAL Space department (although I didn’t know what it would involve) as I have a personal interest in space and enjoy maths/statistics. This week I have been in the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) division and my supervisor was Communications Manager and Data Scientist Poppy Townsend.\nMy first project was to look at the new CEDA website which is under construction at the moment and give some feedback. I had to answer some questions to see if information on the new website was easy to understand/locate and wasn’t missing any sections.\nMy main project was writing Impact Stories for the CEDA website. These explain what uses JASMIN and the CEDA Archive have and why they are irreplaceably important to research projects. These impact stories will also be used when CEDA are applying for renewed funding. I watched several YouTube videos, read books and read example stories which showed me effective ways to structure and write my stories. This was very useful as I have never written scientific impact stories like these before. I planned my stories using the CRACKLE (Challenge, Reasons to Care, Actions, Character, Key Benefits, Lure, Ending) and 5 W’s and a H (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How) frameworks before I started. This highlighted what questions I needed to ask the researcher who used CEDA/JASMIN, to fill in the gaps in my understanding and knowledge of their projects. After the researcher replied to my email with more details, I drafted my impact story. Then, my supervisor Poppy read through my work and together we edited it and made improvements. She showed me techniques to make my writing more effective, easier to understand or read better.\nI was really impressed by how many tours I was taken on this week. They were all really fascinating and easy to understand. I particularly enjoyed seeing the meteorites in the visitor’s center.\nI learned some really good transferable skills this week when I was writing my Impact stories. I no longer do much writing in my A Level subjects, so it is good that I still exercise these skills as they are very important for science communication, and my possible future career.\n\u0026nbsp; Do you know someone who would like to participate in work experience with us? \u0026nbsp; The CEDA team usually supervises between 3-5 students each summer via the STFC work experience scheme. If you want to experience life at CEDA/STFC, take a look at the website for details and mention your interest in CEDA within your application. We will soon be sharing the impact stories and new website that Katherine helped to write and review, keep an eye out over the next few months! "

Ozonesonde soundings measured during the campaign are also available.\nCHABLIS was a major initiative to explore the atmospheric chemistry of the Antarctic boundary layer (ABL) in greater detail and for a longer period of time than has been achieved before. Fieldwork was carried out at the Clean Air Sector Laboratory at Halley station. The field campaign started during the austral summer in January 2004 and continued throughout the winter culminating with an intensive study during the summer of 2004/2005. Major foci for CHABLIS included detailed studies of seasonal oxidant chemistry, annual variation in the boundary layer NOy budget and elucidating air/snow transfer processes.\nFor more information about ACTIVE, please see http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/active/\nFor more information about CHABLIS, please see http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/chablis/\nBADC Helpdesk 03rd June 2008"

This expertise is frequently limited to just one or two members of staff. When large scale issues like this occur, unfortunately, there are only a few members of staff with the appropriate expertise to help resolve the issues. The backlog has also been exacerbated by staff absence and staff time spent delivering and preparing for our recent online event (on 29/30th Sept).\nWe are doing our best to get through your issues as quickly as possible but unfortunately, at the moment we are likely to take longer to respond to you.\nPlease be assured that we are dealing with the queries as fast as we can. We apologise for the inevitable inconvenience caused.\nBest wishes,\nJASMIN team"

It\u0026rsquo;s been an honour to work with the team as the BADC has grown from humble beginnings to the centre we see today; duly recognised internationally for its excellence in data management, community engagement and support.\u0026rdquo;\nBADC members past and present watch on as Bryan cuts the cake Peter Allan, the first group leader for the BADC, also took the opportunity to recall the BADC\u0026rsquo;s early days and the technological challenges they faced. Reflecting on the advances he has seen in the BADC\u0026rsquo;s services and technology, he said,\n\u0026ldquo;As someone who was there at the start of the BADC, I am amazed at how the technology has advanced and at the things that we can now do with it. The storage capacity has increased a hundred thousand times and users can have their own virtual machines close to the data. This enables science that was completely impractical 20 years ago.\u0026rdquo;\n20 years ago the BADC grew out of the Geophysical Data Facility hosted by SERC. Since then its user community has grown globally, with over 5000 users a year accessing an archive now holding in excess of 140 million files. The BADC, within CEDA, has seen many changes during this time and looks forward to those new challenges always on the horizon.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s to the next 20!\nHappy birthday BADC."

But if you are interested in making measurements of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface from space, you need a clear view of it. Clouds can interfere with our surface temperature data and so they need to be identified in satellite images so we know which pixels to discard. To do this, we have an automated \u0026lsquo;cloud mask\u0026rsquo; which identifies which of the image pixels are likely to contain cloud. Often the cloud mask gets it right, but no cloud mask is perfect and there are times when cloudy pixels are missed, or indeed clear sky gets falsely flagged as cloud. It is important to understand how well we are doing at identifying this cloud, which is actually tricky to do.\nWe need you to help us find out just how accurate our cloud mask is. Everyone in the family can help!\n​Dr Caroline Cox, Research Scientist at RAL Space and part of the CloudCatcher team said: “By taking part in CloudCatcher, people will be genuinely helping us out with our work. We need lots of eyes on these satellite images to help give us good results that we can share with other scientists. Ultimately, science is a team game, and we want people to be part of our team. And we hope that everyone enjoys looking at these fantastic images taken from space as much as we do!\u0026quot;\nHow to take part:\nHave a go at CloudCatcher!\n- On a laptop or PC​ (find the project using this direct link) On a mobile or tablet: iOS devices or Android devices.

Our method for describing experiments, which we developed as part of the ES-DOC initiative, has helped those devising CMIP6 experiments to be clear about their goals and expected methodology, made it easier for those running experiments to know what was intended and will make it clearer for the end users of CMIP6 data to understand the experiments.”\nHowever it’s not just about making the data clearer, this work will also save energy by identifying where experiments overlap. Charlotte said “Our documentation reveals inter-relationships between the CMIP6 experiments which have been exploited by ES-DOC to streamline the documentation burden on scientists and to identify potential energy savings in terms of CPU hours not used.”\nThis paper highlights the ‘behind the scenes’ work that CEDA are involved with that benefits the climate science community by streamlining future CMIP workflows and potentially saving energy along the way!\nYou can take a look at the paper here.\nThis figure from the paper shows an overview of the CMIP6 MIPs (purple) and their experiments (blue). A few core experiments such as the pre-industrial control (piControl), the historical experiment and the future scenario experiment ssp245 form part of the protocol for many of the MIPs."

        content: "What are impact stories and why are they essential? \u0026nbsp; Firstly - let’s explain what we mean by ‘impact stories’. These ‘one-pagers’ are short case studies about how CEDA services have enabled you (our users) to complete your research projects. This may be because JASMIN helped you process vast amounts of climate data, the CEDA archive provided invaluable satellite data to aid your research, or maybe CEDA staff members provided you with expertise and guidance about data formatting.\nBut it’s not just about how CEDA helped you personally. We need to demonstrate how our services enable impactful science that benefits wider society. This is fast becoming an essential requirement from our funders - and without continued funding CEDA services would cease to exist. We will begin by collecting basic impact information from JASMIN users in early 2019. This is in response to the Phase 4 upgrade funding that we received in 2018. CEDA need to show outputs from this funding and we hope to do this by collecting a selection of impact stories from JASMIN users.\nYou can see examples of previous JASMIN impact stories in the document here.\nHow you can help \u0026nbsp; Submit a few sentences about your impactful research that relied on JASMIN (and/or other CEDA services) via the form here before Friday 15th February. This can either be pre-written text from other impact case studies you have produced, or fill in the basic questions on the form.\nWe are currently just focussing on JASMIN impact stories, however if you have anything else of relevance then feel free to fill in the form too.\nThe CEDA team will review submissions and contact users with relevant stories that we would like to follow up by 28th February. CEDA will then work with the chosen users in March to help write and develop the impact story.\nWhere the stories will be shared \u0026nbsp; Once we have collected the impact stories, predominantly they will be used within CEDA’s annual reports and in a use case document provided to our funders. We will also add them to our websites and link to them on our social media channels (predominantly Twitter - @cedanews). They are also likely to be used by members of the CEDA team in oral presentations at conferences and meetings, both within the UK and globally.\nIn addition to this, our partner/host organisations (NERC, NCAS, NCEO, STFC) may wish to reuse relevant stories for their own purposes, similar to those mentioned above.\nThis will provide the individual researchers, research projects, and institutions to reach a wide audience of environmental scientists. All stories will be appropriately credited.\nWhy you should help! \u0026nbsp; Your stories will help CEDA to receive continued funding Your research will receive more visibility with a wide range of environmental scientists (if appropriate) You will be entered into a random draw to win a £20 Amazon voucher* We’ve tried to make this process as easy, useful and quick as possible for all involved. It won’t take you long to complete, but the output will be helping CEDA services to continue to exist. Why are we asking you to report ‘yet another’ impact thing? \u0026nbsp; Most of the time we do not know what impactful science CEDA has enabled, unless you (our users) tell us about it - and as previously discussed, we increasingly need to provide this information to our funders.\nPoppy Townsend, CEDA communications manager, recently undertook a MSc dissertation, with UWE Bristol, to investigate how CEDA could collect impact stories in the most efficient way. This consisted of a user survey (n = 520) and focus groups (n = 26). The findings are discussed below, and we have tried to adapt the collection process to be as close to your requests as possible.\nThe key findings showed that users would prefer CEDA to collect impact information via channels that they already submit information to. However, the data shows there are no universal existing processes that CEDA could use to harvest this information - which is why we need to use a webform.\nAnother key finding was that users did not want to waste time writing a story that may not be relevant or might not be used. We are therefore only asking you to submit very basic information - a few sentences at most - or pre-written text that you already have. It was also important to users that guidance be provided when writing and developing the impact stories - which is why we will be helping the chosen users throughout. The results also showed that users would prefer impact information to be collected at the end of their projects. However, it would be unfeasible for CEDA to track and contact thousands of different projects on different timescales; with many end dates changing or being extended. We will trial a yearly collection process, starting with a collection period between January-March. We believe this to be a ‘quieter’ time of year when teaching schedules, conferences and holidays are considered.\nYou can read Poppy’s MSc project report here.\nIf you have any questions about this work, please contact poppy.townsend@stfc.ac.uk\n* The voucher winner will be chosen via a random number generator. Only appropriate and relevant submissions will be taken into the draw. There will be no cash alternative, but an alternative voucher vendor may be considered. The voucher will be provided to respondents at the discretion of STFC."

        content: "During the recent CEDA/JASMIN downtime we took the opportunity to make a range of changes, mostly behind the scenes, to make things more resilient and roll out a few enhancements. We’ve rounded these up here to share with our communities, to show how we made the best of the inevitable disruption to make improvements which benefit our user communities and ourselves in our day-to-day operations.\nCEDA sites \u0026nbsp; To ensure we remained visible during this period, and to improve resilience overall, we migrated a range of our sites away from hosting on JASMIN to external, cloud-based platforms. The new deployments have fewer moving parts and provide better content control and security, but crucially remain online when local issues occur, to help keep our user community up-to-date with developments at CEDA.\nIn particular, we rolled out a new-look site at: www.ceda.ac.uk. This includes the integration of a service-wide search feature to search across all CEDA sites, plus an improved presentation of news items and a new status page tracking current and future incidents.\nThe new front page of the CEDA website We also ported our main front page for the CEDA Archive site (archive.ceda.ac.uk) and CEDA Artefacts service (artefacts.ceda.ac.uk) to cloud-hosted services.\nData Catalogue sites \u0026nbsp; With more citations in the literature for our datasets, it is important that related catalogue entries (especially our DOIed datasets) remain online. To ensure this, we prepared our catalogue service for deployment within the cloud, creating a more resilient service in the long run. We also released the first step towards improved record-to-record connectivity and searchability by embedding search within catalogue records to deliver filtering options to large dataset collections such as the FAAM aircraft dataset collection.\nThese improvements have reduced service load, improved rendering times for records and provided a more stable catalogue service for users as a result.\nWe also moved NERC’s central data catalogue (data-search.nerc.ac.uk) to a ‘containerised’ deployment. This makes more efficient use of resources and means that we can more readily redeploy this service, initially into the cloud during the JASMIN downtime, but now within our existing infrastructure whilst we seek a longer-term, more resilient option.\nJASMIN Improvements \u0026nbsp; Though JASMIN itself was offline for a number of days, we took the opportunity to carry out a number of essential tasks to minimise future service interruptions. The main one of these was upgrading Slurm to roll out important security updates. Meanwhile, our infrastructure team worked diligently behind the scenes to ensure a smooth shutdown and restart of the many subsystems which JASMIN and CEDA services depend on. Additionally, they undertook a number of hardware maintenance tasks to ensure the smooth running of the service.\nOther CEDA Work \u0026nbsp; Key database services were updated to maintain secure operation and minimise future interruptions.\nCEDA staff also worked on a raft of other developments that are in the pipeline and hopefully should be rolled out in the coming months.\nMeanwhile, the CEDA and JASMIN teams continue to review the impact of the downtime from several perspectives, to help improve advice, resilience and service delivery to our user communities."

        content: "Satellites and climate models are renowned for their ability to produce large amounts of data - as such, the CEDA Archive handles the largest datasets amongst the NERC Environmental Data Service (NERC’s collection of environmental data centres). Big data is not just a challenge for the CEDA Archive; the other NERC data centres are increasingly in discussions with researchers who have data that is too large for their infrastructures. As CEDA is at the forefront of development of infrastructure and services for large data volumes we have been sharing and integrating this knowledge across the NERC EDS. Here we highlight four different pieces of work that are ongoing behind the scenes to adapt to our big data challenges. WORKING WITH THE NERC ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SERVICE \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; CEDA is assisting as the storage component for some of the large datasets managed by the other NERC data centres. This is because their infrastructures are not as big as ours, and therefore cannot hold large data volumes. As a result, we have adapted the way researchers deposit data. The system now allows any environmental researcher to deposit large data at CEDA, it is then managed by the relevant data centre as normal. We have also created a new system that allows the coordination of data management across the EDS. This improves efficiency and communication between the various data centres. MONITORING DATA INGESTION \u0026nbsp; As the volume and variety of data increase daily in the CEDA Archive, internal improvements are frequently required to the data ingestion process. We have recently engineered a new monitoring system that notifies relevant staff about each file delivered to the CEDA Archive. This allows us to see the overall deposit rate and helps us debug issues in a visual way. This piece of work allows us to spot issues and improve processes - meaning that data is more efficiently archived. CEDA SERVICES INVENTORY, HELPING US KEEP TRACK \u0026nbsp; Not only does CEDA need to monitor data ingestion, we also need to track ~130 services. To deal with this challenge, we have developed and implemented an inventory of services with a simple web interface. The inventory identifies who is responsible and can restore a service that is broken. This simple tracking tool allows us to resolve service issues more efficiently - therefore reducing the service downtime for users.\nENABLING USER WORKFLOWS ACROSS HETEROGENEOUS STORAGE \u0026nbsp; As big data continues to grow in the environmental sector, the storage infrastructures must keep up. In response to data growth, we have moved away from a traditional storage architecture, towards a more heterogeneous storage environment. This evolution means data on the CEDA Archive is making use of various different storage technologies. Each of these has its own properties and best methods of working, with different interfaces and lag times. This can present challenges to users as it complicates workflows. The CEDA team have been working on new ways to assist users using the various storage types, including the development of the Near-line archive (NLA), Joint Data Migration Application (JDMA) and S3netCDF. We are continually developing new ways to use our storage media types, to improve efficiency and deliver the best user experience possible. All of the work in this article is covered in more detail in our latest Annual Report (19-20), find it here.. "

The award ceremony is held to ‘recognise the achievements of all of our apprentices working across the breadth of operations.’ Matthew received the Apprentice Peer Support award and was ‘highly commended’ for the Apprentice Outreach Award. The peer support award is described as ‘recognising the support of another apprentice who you feel has gone ‘above and beyond’ in providing you with support, advice and guidance’. Matthew was nominated by his peers because of his dry sense of humour, straight talking and academic support. Matthew’s outreach commendation was because for the second year in a row, his submission to the RSE Conference was accepted (submissions are peer-reviewed and have quite a high rejection rate). This year he gave a walk-though on the work he did in STFC’s Technology department on Jupyter notebooks. Apprentices get the opportunity to experience a variety of STFC work by working on a rotational basis around different departments. Within CEDA, Matthew has been working on a tool to be used by other CEDA staff for metrics gathering of certain services. The metrics are used in a graphical reporting tool which allows tracking of this data over time. This is a much improved tool over the previous version, which required manual calculations. Matthew’s work is therefore essential for reducing staff time spent on this particular task. A big well done and thank you to Matthew for all of his hard work! If you’d like to know more about the STFC Apprenticeship scheme, take a look here."

We still foresee a few problems, so please tell us if you spot anything.\nWe have learnt several important lessons from this experience:\nOur back ups work! Although the process has taken a little longer than we first estimated, the action of restoring data from back ups has been successful. Some internal processes need to change. We need to tighten up the way we add/delete data from the archive to make sure all files are counted in and out properly.

ECMWF are presently producing their latest re-analysis product, ERA5, which promises even greater spatial and temporal resolutions as well as new parameters. However, with improved resolution comes greater data volumes, with ERA5 forecast to produce around 10 Pb worth of data by the end of 2018.\nThough there is strong demand for some ERA5 data to be held by CEDA to support regular use of these data by multiple users, the complete dataset is well beyond our capacity, but CEDA are seeking to support our users’ needs where possible. CEDA has capacity to copy around 2Pb of ECMWF data onto JASMIN disks, with options to have more on tape, through which support will look to supply data in four categories:\nLow volume, general interest data (E.g. monthly mean surface fields): these will be copied in full, high resolution and ensemble products; Medium volume (e.g. hourly surface fields): a selection of variables will be copied, for the full time series; High volume (e.g. hourly model level fields): only data which is specifically requested will be copied, and only for specified time periods; Support for replication of ERA5t data onto a Group Work Space into a rolling archive \u0026ndash; we don’t expect to archive this data permanently, as they will be superceded by ERA5. Details are not fixed, and we will adjust our plans to take into account user requests. More details can be seen in the following document: CEDA support for ERA5 and other ECMWF product We welcome feedback from our user community as we continue to refine our plans for ERA5 provision. To do so, please get in touch with us via [support@ceda.ac.uk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk?subject=CEDA data provision for ERA5 users \u0026ldquo;Email CEDA your thoughts about our ERA5 data provision plan\u0026rdquo;)\nCEDA Team"

However, Graham will be at his poster between 14:00-15:45 in Hall 1 location 55.\nThis work discussed the way CEDA pulls together metadata at various levels to give a comprehensive approach to its data cataloguing. At the finest grained level this involved harvesting metadata such as parameter information directly from 220 million files in the archive! However, that approach has to be augmented with a complementary Manual Metadata Store to cover our large number of datasets where this isn’t possible, those which are: offline, external, have been removed from the archive or simply can’t be scanned or yield incorrect file-level metadata.\nSession link: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/30950\nAbstract link: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/EGU2019-16513.pdf\nPoster link: http://cedadocs.ceda.ac.uk/1386/\nGathering impact stories from JASMIN users\nPoppy Townsend is giving a talk on Wednesday at 11.45 in Room L8.\nThis work summarises the work undertaken by Poppy’s MSc project and subsequent actions CEDA have implemented since its completion.

The CDS provides a single public point of access for freely available climate-related observations, re-analyses and model data. This is achieved using a distributed architecture, with individual participating data providers hosting and serving data through to the CDS via an agreed set of web service interfaces. The CP4CDS project was established to provide access to a quality controlled subset of CMIP5 model data and is led by CEDA working together with partners DKRZ and IPSL.\nSession link: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/30943\nAbstract link: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/EGU2019-18192.pdf"

However, CEDA are pleased to announce a major step towards helping resolve this conundrum; bringing the power of industry search tools and direct metadata harvesting at scale to solve these problems.\nThe CEDA Catalogue now allows users to search by \u0026ldquo;variable\u0026rdquo;. This work builds upon a significant project to scan all data files (100s of millions) in the CEDA Archive and to index the resulting metadata into a single store. CEDA\u0026rsquo;s new data search allows you to search by:\nVariable long names Variable CF standard names Variable IDs (such as MIP ids) Record titles, abstracts, keywords and abbreviations A free-text search now queries metadata held in titles, abstracts and keywords within the major catalogue records. It also queries the various variable names that are found in the data files. When the user visits the catalogue record, she will see a list of variables (and their associated attributes, such as \u0026ldquo;units\u0026rdquo;) available for the selected dataset.\nFor example, through the catalogue search you can generate a query for \u0026ldquo;ozone\u0026rdquo;. An example hit will take you here. Inside the \u0026ldquo;Variables\u0026rdquo; tab you will find a list of variables inside the data files, see Figure 1 below.\nScreenshot of variable tab in the CEDA catalogue records Figure 1. Example of variable tab from the ozone search result on the CEDA catalogue, as described above. The variables tab shows 24 parameters with additional information such as standard names, long names, and units.\nSearch results can also be filtered by the different record types in the catalogue and re-ordered based on your preference: by search relevance or in alphabetical order. In addition, variable information is available on dataset records linking long and standard names with variable IDs and units to provide a fuller picture of the data holdings.\nThis is part of a new, improved search tool on the CEDA Catalogue, which we\u0026rsquo;ll be developing further over the coming months to bring even more enhanced search features. This functionality is new and we encourage users to share their feedback on how it can be improved.\nUsing ElasticSearch technology and harvesting the power of the JASMIN system, this project provides a highly scalable indexing solution that supports a rich and flexible query model. CEDA can now easily join up our extensive data catalogue with variable details harvested directly from each file in the entire archive; resulting in enhanced catalogue search functionality and variable listings on catalogue records.\nSummary of variable search"

        content: "CEDA staff have contributed to a new search tool launched on 5th September by Google that aims to help scientists, policy makers and other user groups more easily find the data required for their work and their stories, or simply to satisfy their intellectual curiosity.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s world, scientists in many disciplines and a growing number of journalists live and breathe data. There are many thousands of data repositories on the web, providing access to millions of datasets; and local and national governments around the world publish their data as well. CEDA’s own archive holds over 6 Petabytes of data with over 154 million files; all with a focus on atmospheric and earth observation fields.\nUK Research and Innovation, the umbrella organisation that CEDA sits beneath, has made commitments for easy access to data. CEDA’s Data and Programme Manager, Dr Sarah Callaghan, was one expert who worked with Google to help develop the Dataset Search, launched on 5th September.\nSimilar to how Google Scholar works, Dataset Search lets users find datasets wherever they’re hosted, whether it’s a publisher\u0026rsquo;s site, a digital library, or an author\u0026rsquo;s personal web page.\nGoogle approached UK Research and Innovation’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) to help ensure their world-leading environmental datasets were included. The heritage in these organisations managing huge complex datasets on the atmosphere, oceans, climate change, and even data about the solar system, led Sarah, to work with Google on the project.\nDr Sarah Callaghan said: “In CEDA we manage, archive and distribute petabytes of data to make it available to scientific researchers and other interested parties. My experience making datasets findable, usable and interoperable enabled me to advise Google on their Dataset Search and how to best display their search results.”\n“I was able to draw on my work with NERC and STFC datasets, not only in just archiving and managing data for the long term and the scientific record, but also helping users to understand if a dataset is the right one for their purposes.”\nTo create Dataset Search, Google developed guidelines for dataset providers to describe their data in a way that search engines can better understand the content of their pages. These guidelines include salient information about datasets: who created the dataset, when it was published, how the data was collected, what the terms are for using the data, etc. This enables search engines to collect and link this information, analyse where different versions of the same dataset might be, and find publications that may be describing or discussing the dataset. The approach is based on an open standard for describing this information (schema.org). Many environmental data, held in the CEDA archive, are already described in this way and are particularly good examples of findable, user-friendly datasets. “Standardised ways of describing data allows us to help researchers by building tools and services to make it easier to find and use data” said Sarah, “If people don’t know what datasets exist, they won’t know how to look for what they need to solve their environmental problems. For example, an ecologist might not know where to go to find, or how to access the rainfall data needed to understand a changing habitat. Making data easier to find, will help introduce researchers from a variety of disciplines to the vast amount of data I and my colleagues manage for NERC and STFC.”\nThe new Google Dataset Search offers references to most datasets in environmental and social sciences, as well as data from other disciplines including government data and data provided by news organisations.\nProfessor Tim Wheeler, Director of Research and Innovation at NERC, said: “NERC is constantly working to raise awareness of the wealth of environmental information held within its Data Centres, and to improve access to it. This new tool will make it easier than ever for the public, business and science professionals to find and access the data that they’re looking for. We want to get as many people as possible interested in and able to benefit from data collected by the environmental science that we fund.”\nDr Chris Mutlow, Director of STFC RAL Space said, “This work builds on RAL Space experience in data management and commitment to making it easily accessible. The expertise that Sarah and our other CEDA data scientists have in this area is becoming an ever more important global resource to call upon. The data centres we manage for NERC and STFC play an important role in scientific research and are a facility available to all.”\nAn example search for weather records in Google Dataset Search.

        content: "Coinciding with the launch the International Space Innovation Centre at Harwell Oxford, STFC RAL\u0026rsquo;s Centre for Environmental Data Archival deployed a new data visualisation service for Earth Observation data.\nThe Science Visualisation Service for Earth Observation (SVSeo) has been developed as a web based application to allow users in the new International Space Innovation Centre (ISIC) and the wider community to visualise and make use of Earth Observation data and climate model simulations. The application uses an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard Web Map Service (WMS) to display datasets as maps in the visualisation client.\nUsers can visually explore large and complex environmental datasets from observations and models, view, step through and zoom in to gridded datasets on a map view, export images as figures and create animations. Different views can be easily overlaid, e.g. different parameters in the same data, or different datasets. The images and animations can be exported for viewing and manipulation on the ISIC videowall, on Google Earth or other viewing software.\nThe SVSeo displays datasets which are made available through the CEDA Centre for Environmental Data Archival (http://ceda.ac.uk) archives through the CEDA OGC Web Services framework COWS, but can include any remote data which are exposed via a WMS interface.

        content: "On Thursday 22nd November we’ll be transferring items from the CEDA Document Repository service to Zenodo, a service operated by CERN, where CEDA will maintain a ‘CEDA Document Repository Community’ to aid access to dataset related documentation.\nThis new approach by CEDA will give additional benefits to users wishing to supply dataset related items (e.g. calibration details, code, documentation etc) at the same time reducing the overall support overheads for CEDA.\nFor more information on this change read on.\nThe history of the CEDA Document Repository service. \u0026nbsp; CEDA originally set up the CEDA Document Repository to act as a ‘grey literature’ store to support CEDA’s community, to aid access to items that relate to, and aid the use of, data in the CEDA archives. This was one of the outputs of the “Overlay Journal Infrastructure for Meteorological Sciences (OJIMS) project”, and was launched on 30 October 2008, since which time over 1250 items have been deposited.\nWhy the move to Zenodo? \u0026nbsp; The present CEDA Document Repository relies on CEDA operating a dedicated EPrints service with all the associated efforts required to ensure that it remains up to date and secure. At the time it was first made available generic services such as Zenodo were not available, but now offer an excellent alternative.\nThough CEDA could add additional functionality to the present service Zenodo already offers these features and provides users additional options too. These include:\nAbility to link to ORCID Ids and profiles Free DOI minting for items Excellent version control and use of other identifiers/linking to related resources Option to (auto)publish releases from Github repositories Option of submitting items to multiple Zenodo ‘Communities’ What will happen to items in the CEDA Document Repository \u0026nbsp; CEDA will upload all files and associated ‘metadata’ to Zenodo from the CEDA Document Repository, adding these automatically to the CEDA Document Repository Community on Zenodo. The metadata field matching isn’t exact, but we’ve preserved all the necessary information on the Zenodo items as best as possible.\nAdditionally, we’ve added in details of the URL where the item was formerly held to aid traceability of the resource and we’ll set up a redirect service to these new items from the old URLs to ensure that old references to items in the CEDA Document Repository service will resolve to their Zenodo equivalent… And as these will get a DOI each this will greatly aid future discoverability of these items!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the scope of this new Zenodo community for CEDA Document providers? \u0026nbsp; The scope of the CEDA Document Community within Zenodo mirrors that for the CEDA Document service - i.e. it is for items of \u0026lsquo;grey literature\u0026rsquo; that are related to CEDA and its services. For example, calibation details, format documentation, flight logs etc. that relate to data held in the CEDA Archives, or items such as relevant presentations relating to data holdings or CEDA work as a whole.\nNote, though, as for all other data centres in the NERC Environemtnal Data Service, Zenodo is not deemed to be an acceptable repository for NERC funded data. Such data must be offered to a NERC data centre in line with the NERC Data Policy.\nWhat about the original item owners? What do they need to do?\nAs CEDA will be managing the transfer of all items to Zenodo there are no additional steps needed by the original depositors of content in the CEDA Document Repository. Once the migration has been completed we will:\nUpdate catalogue links to items Message original depositors to let them know their items have been transferred The original depositors will then have the option of creating their own Zenodo user account and then messaging the CEDA Helpdesk to request transfer of ownership of Zenodo items. We will then get in touch with Zenodo to ask for these to be transferred to the original owner.\nIf you have any questions or comments please get in touch with the CEDA helpdesk."

        content: "A diverse set of companies, governments and individuals are now able to access global climate projections data via the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). C3S provides climate data to support adaptation and mitigation measures across Europe.\nClimate data are increasingly used by people and organisations outside of the core climate science community. For example by insurance companies evaluating extreme weather risks, or the agricultural sector to improve food production and security. Climate data are large and complex so can be difficult to understand by these new communities.\nA flooded farmers field in North Dakota, USA. Credit: USDA (creative commons license) Image: A flooded farmers field in North Dakota, USA. Credit: USDA (**creative commons license)\nAn updated global assessment of climate change is being published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) later this year. It is used by a range of non-specialist users including government decision makers. Improving accessibility to the data behind the report is essential for ensuring its use and understanding by the huge range of people who will be affected by or can mitigate against climate change. Global climate projections from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) supporting the IPCC assessment are now more widely accessible because of work carried out by the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA). Building on a massive international effort, CEDA and collaborators have completed the final steps to harmonise the data and make it accessible to a wider range of users outside of the core climate science community. CEDA has helped provide a subset of data to C3S that focuses on the requirements of the climate mitigation and adaptation communities. These data are part of a global collaborative effort by all of the world\u0026rsquo;s major climate modelling centres through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The subset of variables and models are from nine of the most popular CMIP6 experiments exploring scenarios and reference simulations which are central to the IPCC assessments.\nEnsuring data has undergone quality control \u0026nbsp; Large scale model datasets are complex and can have irregularities that make it difficult for non-specialist users to understand. Detailed and comprehensive checks on the data have been carried out by CEDA and partners at the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) and German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ).\nIt is important to document data so that any differences between models are explained and understood. Differences might appear surprising to users who don’t understand the details of how the model is working - therefore, describing any differences clearly and consistently across large datasets can help data be used more effectively to solve real world problems. Forest fire in Wales, UK.

Credit: Quarrie Photography | Jeff Walsh | Cass Hodge (creative commons license)\nImproving accessibility \u0026nbsp; Data should meet the expectations of the climate modelling community, but there is more to be done to make the data truly accessible for new users. A new Web Processing Service has been built with the German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ) to allow users to define which spatial and temporal sections of the data they need. This is beneficial because users don’t need to download all of the files - they can simply choose the data that fits their needs. This reduction in data download means that it is much more efficient to both the user and the service provider. Businesses and civil society organisations working to mitigate the effects of climate change could save time and storage resources by using these new services. The combination of the quality control work and the data subsetter tool makes the data more accessible for users outside of the core climate community, as it is easier to get at the data they need. The Web Processing Service also makes it possible for the data to be accessed directly by tools being provided by other developers working for C3S, so users will get the added value of being able to explore and analyse the data with a wide variety of software applications.\nLarge datasets, like CMIP6, can be intimidating for users outside of the core climate science community. The work that CEDA, and partners, do is essential to continue to simplify and improve access to these critical datasets. Footnotes:\nThe Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) provides services on behalf of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) and the National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO).

        content: "Two CEDA staff joined the FAAM aircraft team on Wednesday 16th March 2016, as it took to the skies over East Anglia for the WINTEX campaign. Poppy Townsend and Kate Winfield were there as part of CEDA\u0026rsquo;s engagement with the research community: Poppy beginning a 3 month detachment with FAAM as part of her grad scheme at CEDA; and Kate to get first hand experience of data producers and the underlying science of our core community. Poppy and Kate ready to board FAAM Aircraft Kate and Poppy in-flight selfie Poppy says “Within CEDA, I usually see the end part of a project\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle, whereas at FAAM I’ll see the beginning. This placement is a great opportunity for me to gain a greater understanding of how different instrumentation is used to collect atmospheric measurements. My work at FAAM will increase our awareness of the needs of the wider atmospheric community thus helping to increase collaboration between FAAM and CEDA. Participating on the flight was a truly unique experience and hopefully I’ll get another one over the next 3 months!”\nFor Kate the experience is a real highlight as part of her Year in Industry placement helping her to gain an in depth understanding of atmospheric science. A view inside the FAAM aircraft “It was an amazing experience to be able to engage with data providers and see where key data for CEDA comes from. It was also a great opportunity to see how the instrument scientists operate instruments and to see how the scientists are able to plot graphs to check the data before it is processed and delivered to CEDA. It was also impressive to see theories learnt in lectures being put into practise and seeing the results. I have learnt a lot in just a small amount of time and it is an experience I will never forget.”\nKate\u0026rsquo;s data curation placement with CEDA covers all aspects of the data life cycle, from a major overhaul of CEDA’s data catalogue records, data ingestion and developing user friendly support materials. This ensures the reliable curation and long term preservation of environmental data, such as FAAM data.\nSunsetting over clouds Poppy’s placement at FAAM focuses on facilitating post-flight validation and quality control to improve the flow of core FAAM data to CEDA. She\u0026rsquo;ll be presenting about this at the RMetSoc student conference in July.\nKate will be returning back to Coventry University for her final year of her BSc Geography degree, where she will be sharing her experiences with staff and students.\nOpportunities like this play a key role in shaping our Data Scientists of the future and CEDA’s engagement with our core communities!"

Often the informaiton availalbe was ambiguous and data format information missing, but Nicola succeeded in greatly improving informaiton on the 512 flights and even helped to provide scripts to provide preview images of the ATM data now in the NEODC archive. For more information see Nicola\u0026rsquo;s end of placement talk here.\nJenna Thornton - Revamping BADC\u0026rsquo;s metadata archiveMOLES2-MOLES3 Metadata model diagram from Jenna\u0026rsquo;s presentation \u0026nbsp; Jenna Thornton was tasked with working through the entire BADC metadata catalogue, carrying out a thoughour - and much needed - review of all the informaiton held on BADC datasets. This was partly in response to NERC\u0026rsquo;s Science Information Strategy Implementation Programme to improve metadata held on NERC data and also to improve the informaiton presented to BADC users on some of the most popular datasets. Having improved the metadata records on over 200 datasets Jenna has also helped CEDA to record a webguide to the explain to our users on how to use our metadata catalogue system - which will be of great help to data users. Jenna\u0026rsquo;s work is summaries in her presenation here.\nChris Brambley - Making a early 20th Century solar images at UKSSDC discoverable \u0026nbsp; The UKSSDC has over 25,400 images of the sun dating from 1903 to 1942 on glass plates and photo paper which UKSSDC received from the University of Cambridge in 2008. Chris worked over the summer to catalogue (and dusted!) all these images and added details of the entire physical archive to the UKSSDC\u0026rsquo;s SQL catalogue and has created a web service for users to query the solar images records. Thanks to Chris\u0026rsquo;s hard work these records are now discoverable by the science community for the first time, opening up this wealth of historic data. Chris\u0026rsquo;s presentation can be seen here.\nJonathan Warburton - Digitising photo-heliographic records from 1875 \u0026nbsp; Working on a project to digitise books of photo-heliographic records, dating from 1875 Jonathan was working on assessing the resources needed to complete this digitisation project. The early books are now very fragile, requiring great care in dealing with them, but Jonathan digitised all of the books and made them available on the Royal Observatory Greenwich - Photo-Heliographic Results pages of the UKSSDC website. To find out more about his work please see his end of placement presentation here.\nJoseph Landsdowne - IPython Parallel Processing of CMIP5 data \u0026nbsp; Our final student, Joseph Landsdowne worked on a project to test out parallel Python packages to process the data held in CEDA’s new parallel access storage and processing architecture. Joseph then linked up the processing to a web-based Python tool to control the back-end processing. This work will feed into CEDA’s new environmental data processing suite for the wider user community. Joseph\u0026rsquo;s presentation about his work within the IPython Parallel Processing of CMIP5 data can bee seen here, while the project pages are accessible here."

During this time their work touched on data from three of the data centres operated by CEDA: the British Atmospheric Data Centre, NERC Earth Observation Data Centre and the UK Solar System Data Centre.\nThree of these students were working together as part of a team lead by Esther Conway feeding into the ESA funded Long-Term Data Preservation (LTDP) project, while the forth worked within the UKSSDC.\nFurther details of their work are given below.\nCEDA will be looking to make further opportunities available to students in the future and will make further announcements of such opportunities through the CEDA website and social media.\nEach of the 4 students have made a significant contribution the work of the Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) in the last few months, for which CEDA would like to state their thanks.\nJames Parkinson – Improving online access to ionospheric data. \u0026nbsp; The UK Solar System Data Centre has been collecting ionospheric data since 1957, and has built up an extensive archive of such data from the oldest records dating back to 1931 to data only a few minutes old. As a result, these data are available at varying levels of detail and in a variety of formats. In particular, the online access to these data has also altered gradually over the years, with different tools providing access to different subsets of ionospheric data.\nPhysics undergraduate James Parkinson joined the UKSSDC for the summer to work on a project to improve the online access to ionospheric data for UKSSDC users. James quick came to grips with the data and the web services and, with a fresh pair of eyes on the situation, began with a thorough assessment of the existing provision. During the course of his work James worked up the design of a new interface to bring together ionospheric data services in one place and even implemented some of the new code that will be needed to make it operational – a very impressive feat given the short duration of the project!\nHarry Jones, Charles Newey and Robin Pinder – Long Term Data Preservation \u0026amp; CEDA wide archive format review. \u0026nbsp; CEDA’s Esther Conway brought together these three summer placement students this summer to work on the ESA funded “Long Term Data Preservation” project with the aim of carrying out an archive wide format review. This was no small task for the team given the scale (both in size and number of files) and breadth of the BADC and NEODC holdings built up over a number of decades, during which the archive had developed in a very heterogeneous and organic fashion. As a consequence a manual inspection of the archive wasn’t practical and simple off-the-shelf solutions were not available to the team. Coming to grips with the task ahead the team worked alongside members of the CEDA team to scope out and develop a way to sort through the huge mass of data with little or no format documentation.\nBuilding on earlier attempts by CEDA to get a handle on the plethora of formats in the CEDA archive, Charlie set to work developing what would eventually become the HEFTI (Helping Environmental Formats Through Identification) software. Building up from a script that initially followed conventional methods of just checking file extensions, Charlie went on to develop other diagnostic methods used by the HEFTI software. These were required as the file extensions were often found to have been utilised to store information about the parameters or instrument names (for example) as opposed to the format of the data. Instead, Charlie developed the system to make use of additional information found by other members of the team, either by determining patterns within filenames themselves or, more usefully, determining the format’s “magic number” within the first few bytes of a file that would help fingerprint the format used.\nHarry played a key role in analysing data in the archive found to be in unknown, non-standard formats. Over the course of the project he was able to determining patterns, magic numbers of format and other crucial diagnostic clues that enabled Charlie to continue to develop the HEFTI framework to diagnose more and more formats, especially of the more obscure, bespoke formats used by specific instruments or within given projects or institutions.\nAt the same time that the format diagnostic tool kit was developed Robin compiled information on the most important formats and their versions, detailing the relevant organisations or communities and assessing their long term preservation risk. This task\nFormats have a related software set that must be available to the user whether through the archive itself or as is simpler for the archive from some outside organisation. But the community will need checking to make sure the format will not fall into disuse and the data become unreadable. This task was a crucial step forward for CEDA as it began to ensure that each format found within the CEDA archive was risk assessed and preservation plans began to be formed by assessing matters such as the level of documentation, community use and strength of supporting community and tools. Given its importance, Harry also continued this work on following the ending of the summer project itself.\nThe outcome of this work is that CEDA now have a considerably better understanding of the formats contained within the CEDA archives. Of particular note is that the team was able to determined, by assessing the data formats, what is of value to keep, what is possible to keep, and what must be kept due to obligations."

        content: "The data centre function of CEDA celebrated 25 years of existence in October 2019. As we approach the end of this year, we take a look back to see what has changed along the way.\nOur longest serving employee, Sam Pepler, has been working at CEDA as Head of Curation since November 1996! “When I joined the team, they’d only just got a website! It was brand new technology at that point. We were just phasing out a large optical jukebox (a robotic data storage device that could automatically load and unload optical discs) - which I think had 60 Gigabytes of data on it. The first hard-disk based system was then introduced with about 120GB - these data volumes are tiny when compared to our current data archive of over 10 Petabytes” explained Sam. CEDA’s data archive holdings have approximately doubled every 1.5 years since Sam has been working here.\nThe CEDA Archive (previously known as BADC and NEODC) now has over 50,000 users, ~13 Petabytes of data held in more than 250 million files. This requires CEDA to be at the forefront of data management best practice and provision of efficient data analysis facilities. Sam explains how this has changed; “We used to receive data in random user-invented formats, but now everyone uses standard formats like NetCDF. That’s made it much easier for us (in CEDA) and principally the user community to access and use our data. We really pushed for this change and I’m proud of how far we’ve come.” Data centres, like CEDA, have positively encouraged the scientific communities to make these changes and continue to do so by facilitating best practice in data management (e.g. issuing DOI’s for datasets).\nWith the ever increasing volume and variety of data in the CEDA Archive, a new solution was necessary for managing access to use and analyse the data. This is where JASMIN stepped in ~7.5 years ago. The flexible storage and shared group workspaces allow projects to bring their own data to use and analyse with the data held in the CEDA Archive - meaning data analysis can occur alongside the long term data archive. JASMIN’s community cloud enables projects to build their own bespoke computing environments to match their needs and showcase their work to their audiences. JASMIN is a globally unique analysis facility that allows researchers to do data intensive research that was not previously possible.\nWhilst many things within CEDA have changed over the last 25 years, there are still some things that have stayed the same. \u0026ldquo;We still use tape technology at the back end of our services and the largest data volumes are still from the climate and earth observation communities - these things haven’t changed\u0026rdquo;, explained Sam.\nOur primary role continues to help the scientific community to do research - and 2019 has been one of our busiest years yet\u0026hellip; with over 7.4 Petabytes of data archived, 517 new JASMIN users, and over 1630 users helped via our helpdesk - to name a few stats! See infographic below for more of our key achievements and stats from this year.\nOver the past 25 years, CEDA has faced many challenges around ever increasing data volumes and user community which has meant that our technology has had to drastically evolve in order to adapt to these needs. We strive to improve our services in order to meet the needs of the community - and hope to continue doing so for the next 25 years too!\nIf you want to know more about what we’ve been up to, take a look at our previous annual reports or our archive of news items.\nStats highlights from 2019: \u0026nbsp;"

        content: "Today is International Women’s Day and we’d like to celebrate our diverse team within CEDA. At present, we have 12 female colleagues who make up approximately 40% of the team. Our roles range from User Support on the helpdesk, to Data Scientists, to Head of CEDA; all falling within Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) areas. Historically, there are inequalities in gender within these areas and we are continually working to improve the balance.\nAlthough we are proud of our current gender ratio of 12 females in 28 staff, we are aware that we currently do not have any females in the core CEDA developer group. Although positively, many of our female staff do develop code essential for data centre tasks. Another inequality that should be addressed is that we don’t currently have any male project managers - gender parity works both ways! We acknowledge these differences and will work towards a more equal balance.\nVictoria Bennett sharing her knowledge of Earth Observation at the Satellite Applications Catapult Figure 1: Victoria Bennett, Head of CEDA, sharing her knowledge of Earth Observation data at the Satellite Applications Catapult\nOne way in which we hope to help increase future ratios is by being actively involved in public engagement activities. We believe it is essential to show girls (and boys) what exciting careers are out there and promote the important role of environmental science within the real world. There are many reasons why people choose STEM careers, but here are a selection of our motivations:\n‘Fabulous physics teacher at school’\n‘Watching David Attenborough’s documentaries with my family as a child’\n‘Following in my parents footsteps of studying physics’\n‘School Geography lessons’\nPoppy Townsend at a public event in Edinburgh Figure 2: Poppy Townsend, CEDA Communications Manager, at a public engagement event in Edinburgh.\nWe all enjoy our jobs, but the most important thing to us is the fantastic people that we work with and the science that we enable with our work at CEDA. We thrive by working with a diverse mix of interesting and talented people. All of whom help us be involved in cutting edge science projects which help us to piece together the big picture that is our understanding of the environment.\nThis year’s International Women’s Day campaign theme is #PressforProgress. Ultimately, if we work together we can increase gender parity. CEDA are committed to this campaign by ‘maintaining a gender parity mindset’ - ultimately aiming for 50/50 as the goal. Whether that is nominating women for opportunities, or increasing our female/male ratio - we will continue to make our team and workplace a more equal environment.\nYou can find out more about the campaign here: https://www.internationalwomensday.com/PressforProgress\nOur CEDA women - who never seem to be in the same place at the same time for a photo!

The help beacon can be used to search our help documents but also to submit helpdesk queries, with some drop-down options to help you self-categorise your own issue. We encourage all users to make use of submitting your query via this method.\nWhy have we made these changes?\nWe believe these changes will help to make our helpdesk processes more efficient, with benefits for both users and the JASMIN team.\nUsing separate email addresses for our two key services (JASMIN and the CEDA Archive) means we will be able to categorise queries more appropriately and direct them more easily to the right person. We also anticipate improved analytics for each service, enabling us to better focus our efforts to improve systems and services. By encouraging users to use the beacon to categorise your query, it should help to speed up the process for assigning issues to the appropriate JASMIN team member. The main changes have now been completed but we anticipate that some web pages and documentation may take us a while to update with the new helpdesk details. As with all changes, it will take us (and you!) time to adjust - we would love to hear from you if you have any suggestions/comments on these changes.\nA reminder of good practices to follow when contacting the helpdesk\nPlease follow these steps to help us resolve your query more quickly: Only include one issue per query submitted. When multiple issues are submitted in one email chain, it makes it very difficult for the team to distinguish and address each issue. If you have multiple issues, please submit separate emails for them. When letting us know about an issue (e.g. perceived slow performance), please give concise but specific evidence of what happened and when, and where. See here about the kind of detail we need. Sometimes we won’t be able to investigate your issue until we have this detail. JASMIN is a unique and complex service supported by a relatively small team. We do our best to investigate and resolve issues for you, but it’s not always possible to do this quickly, particularly in the current situation where staff are working remotely and access to machine room environments is restricted. Best wishes,\nJASMIN team "

This is to help users judge how suitable such climate data are for an intended application. The user feedback could be comments about assessments, citations, or provenance of the dataset, or other information such as descriptions of uncertainty or data quality. The key point is that this supporting information becomes accessible alongside the data.\nThe CHARMe system is under development and a beta version should be available in mid-2014 with early testing soon after by selected users. The aim is for the system to go live in late 2014, ready to capture and then share the expertise of climate and Earth observation data users around the world.\nFor further details visit: http://charme.org.uk/"

Its goal is to try and find the range of possible climate change in the 21st century. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve been involved with Climateprediction.net from the start. It\u0026rsquo;s the perfect application for public distributed computing\u0026rdquo; said Dr. David Anderson, Director of the SETI@home and BOINC projects, \u0026ldquo;Now, using BOINC, participants won\u0026rsquo;t have to choose between looking for signs of extra-terrestrial life, investigating how proteins form or helping predict the climate of the 21st century; they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to allocate computer time to each project.\u0026rdquo;\nDr. Dave Frame, Climateprediction.net project coordinator, added \u0026ldquo;Given the size and duration of the computing task, the amount of data involved and the fact that all our data is actually generated on participants\u0026rsquo; computers, Climateprediction.net is an ambitious new application of distributed computing. Working with BOINC has allowed us to tap into SETI@home\u0026rsquo;s vast experience, helping us to meet these considerable challenges.\u0026rdquo;\nAnyone can download the BOINC software from www.climateprediction.net which then installs the Met Office\u0026rsquo;s state-of-the-art climate model.

We will provide a period of overlap in which we keep the existing cloud tenancies available whilst at the same time providing access to the new environment in order to support the migration process for users.\nWe will be in touch with you again nearer the time with specific dates and details about the migration process.\nJASMIN Team"

I\u0026rsquo;m glad I logged on to the BADC!\u0026rdquo;\nNeal first seriously used the BADC in the 1990s to obtain TOMS data for validating their model, using tape to transfer all the data. A significant part of Neal\u0026rsquo;s current work on the validation of chemistry-climate models (CCMS) is funded by the EU\u0026rsquo;s SCOUT-O3 project. Neal co-leads one of the work packages on model comparison and evaluation. To carry out this work a central archive of model output from around 10 European models was needed. With help from Ag Stephens the BADC provided the facilities to support the database.\nThis model validation and comparison work of SCOUT-O3 links to the broader Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) activity for SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate) which involves about 15 CCM groups worldwide. CCMVal is coordinated by Veronika Eyring from the DLR Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Germany and Neal is a member of the steering committee. Model data from the 15 CCM groups worldwide was uploaded to the BADC and this database underpinned the model assessment and ozone projections used in the 2006 WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion.\nThe CCMVal database at the BADC is currently being developed into a more managed facility. It has been decided that the database of new model output in support of upcoming ozone and climate assessments and for the planned SPARC CCMVal report on the evaluation of CCMs will also be at the BADC.\nCongratulations to Neal on winning himself an iPAQ hx2490\nBy the way, if you are wondering, the winning answer is that the image is \u0026ldquo;C: over the South pole in October\u0026rdquo; not, as suggested by another user, \u0026ldquo;Mr Dulux\u0026rsquo;s space hopper\u0026rdquo;!\nBADC Helpdesk 28th November 2007"

        content: "One of the most widely used climate datasets has released its biggest update since 2013. Since the initial launch back in 2000, the CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) dataset has been used in thousands of studies worldwide to support research about our changing climate. This dataset is made up of monthly weather measurements going back to 1901. The measurements include temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloud cover and six other climate variables. The observations are supplied from an extensive network of weather stations across Asia, Africa, Europe, North America and South America. CRU TS provides atmospheric scientists with a high-resolution grid of information that can be fed into computer analyses of climate change and climate variability. In addition to climate research, this dataset is often used within the hydrology, civil engineering, financial and insurance sectors.\nVersion 4 of CRU TS, the latest update, gives users access to a bigger set of information about the climate, and related to that, more confidence in diagnosing geographical variation in the climate over the last 120 years. Over the past year, ~2480 users have accessed CRU datasets (all versions) held in our Archive. The new CRU TS (v4.03) is already extremely popular with ~1400 users accessing it since it was released in January. This makes it the top atmospheric dataset that we hold!\nIan Harris, an NCAS researcher in the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, tells us about the recent update: “For many CRU TS variables, there simply aren’t any equivalent datasets. This version’s improved interpolation, the way that we estimate values between known data points, gives us a better way to validate and trace the information. Funding from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science helps us to publish the source observations, improve the dataset and keep it up to date, which is really important because we know that CRU TS enables a lot of climate research.”\nA recently published paper explains the processes and decisions that underpin the latest version of the dataset: Harris, I., Osborn, T.J., Jones, P. et al.

        description: "This year, CEDA had the pleasure of welcoming two industrial placement students, Rory Jenns and Zach Wharton, who joined us as Software Engineers for their Industrial Placement year.",
        
        
        content: "This year, CEDA had the pleasure of welcoming two industrial placement students, Rory Jenns and Zach Wharton, who joined us as Software Engineers for their Industrial Placement year. Hailing from the University of Nottingham and Loughborough University, respectively, Rory and Zach have spent the past 12 months diving into various projects, from software development to stakeholder engagement and system deployment. Let’s take a look at the fantastic work they accomplished during their time with us.\nRevolutionising CEDA\u0026rsquo;s Data Catalogue \u0026nbsp; Zach, with his knack for enhancing user experiences, took on the task of developing new front-end features for the CEDA Data Catalogue.\u0026nbsp; Using JavaScript (a programming language), he introduced an ‘embedded search’ on catalogue record pages allowing users to further refine their searches of related content. This was a game-changer, especially as the increasing connectivity of records was causing longer page load times. Zach’s solution provided a more efficient way to access relevant information, giving users greater control and reducing wait times. Kudos to Zach!\nMeanwhile, Rory focused on a novel implementation in data management: tagging datasets based on the classifications of their licences by what use they permit. This lets users, at a glance, tell if a dataset has a licence for their use (e.g. find data that permits academic or commercial usage). “Changing the data model of the large legacy system comes with risk. So, using Docker, my first step was to ‘sandbox’ the catalogue, creating an isolated local environment to develop.” Rory’s changes also provide greater flexibility in access routes to data associated with different licensing options, allowing CEDA to cater for diverse options needed by data providers storing data in the CEDA archive.\nZach in front of RAL Space's BIG DREAM Enhancing the Archival of Data \u0026nbsp; Rory and Zach’s paths crossed again when they both worked on crucial systems for intaking data from users into the archive.\nRory started his placement by improving ‘Arrivals’, a Python/Django app for reviewing incoming datasets arriving in the archive. He spoke with data scientists at CEDA to find out how they used the system, where improvements could be made, and desired features. Using this knowledge he created web tools that give our data scientists greater visibility and control to review and fix incoming datasets. This allows staff to review datasets from their web browsers, lowering the bar to entry.\nFollowing this, Rory created data workflows across services to automate common work, again lowering the bar to entry. He proudly presented this work in Leeds at the 2024 NCAS Harmony in the Skies Early Careers symposium (https://zenodo.org/records/11109744), increasing the awareness of CEDA and its data scientists’ work to related partners.\nAt the same time, Zach revitalised our ‘FileOps server’, an internal system that has been part of our file processing pipeline for the past two decades. Recognizing the need for modernisation, Zach used a modern technology called FastAPI to simplify and improve the system. This new approach made it easier to develop and maintain, while also making the system more reliable and able to handle a greater volume of requests. This upgrade was a significant milestone for CEDA, ensuring our file operations would continue to be efficient and dependable. Zach\u0026rsquo;s work prepared the ‘FileOps server’ for future growth and adaptability, maintaining high standards in our file management processes.\nRory presenting his work at the NCAS Harmony in the Skies 2024 Early Careers Symposium Engaging with External Partners \u0026nbsp; Our projects often involve collaboration with external partners, Rory and Zach had the chance to engage with some of the big names in environmental data.\nZach worked closely with the Met Office on a project to update the format of rain radar data. He picked up and configured existing codebases to meet the Met Office’s requirements, marking his first experience working with external stakeholders. Reflecting on this, Zach said, “My standout experience at CEDA is most likely working on a software development project with the Met Office. I was able to advance as a software developer because I collaborated with well-known industry names. It was eye-opening to work with external stakeholders and see the real-world applications of our work.”\nRory, on the other hand, engaged with the European Space Agency (ESA) when moving our Data Relay Hub to a new architecture so it is more reliable and can be more easily extended. During this, Rory gained hands-on experience in automating deployments and using infrastructure-as-code tools, such as Ansible and Docker. Using these tools meant that the deployment process was self-documenting and would make the process of moving to the new Data Relay Hub simpler. “Working on the Data Relay Hub has been a unique experience for me. Luckily, I had the chance to work directly with ESA, an opportunity that few this early in their career receive. In the work itself, I made use of a variety of technologies while working through how to implement an operational system.”\nOn top of this, he got to dive into the architecture and design of larger operational systems that move large data volumes (in the terabytes per day). This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing Rory to develop his skills in an innovative environment and experience working with external partners.\nLooking Ahead \u0026nbsp; As their placements come to an end, Rory and Zach are heading back to university to complete their final years. Rory is set to become the President of his university’s ‘CompSoc’ (the School of Computer Science Society) and plans to have his dissertation utilise CEDA’s vast data holdings, inspired by his work here. Zach, meanwhile, will be undertaking a final year project that applies modern machine learning techniques to predict horse racing results using historical data.\nWe’re incredibly proud of the contributions Rory and Zach have made during their time at CEDA and wish them all the best in their future endeavours. Their hard work and dedication have left a lasting impact, and we’re excited to see what they achieve next.\nRory and Zach on Zach’s final day. Pictured with some CEDA colleagues (and Tim Peake!)

In addition to the JASMIN Core deployment at CEDA (RAL), the wider JASMIN network consists of hardware at Reading, Bristol and Leeds Universities, linking key atmospheric research groups across the UK. A significant milestone was achieved recently with the connection of a dedicated 1Gb light path between the JASMIN Core and JASMIN North nodes.\nThe dedicated link to JASMIN-North at Leeds means that moving data between the two Jasmin sites can happen at a much faster rate. Initial tests have shown that speeds of around 90Mb/sec transfer rates are achievable with this new link: a significant improvement on the 2-3Mb/sec rates previously reported. These new transfer rates are also assisted by the fast file systems at both ends.\nJames Groves from NCAS at Leeds University says, “With datasets increasing in size all the time, with a single model run able to produce an output file of around 1.8Tb for one month’s simulation, being able to transfer these data for analysis in a timely fashion is essential for the NCAS scientists distributed around the UK. The Panasas high performance parallel storage is really proving itself to be a reliable and scalable system, an essential component of the UK atmospheric research community’s national capability.”\nLink Notes RAL - HECToR 2 x 1Gbit/s lightpath to data component of the UK National Supercomputing Service in Edinburgh. RAL - MONSooN 1 Gbit/s lightpath to UK Met Office supercomputer in Exeter.

Please refer to the webinar \u0026lsquo;Transitioning\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to SLURM webinar'.\u0026nbsp;\nThere are many benefits of using LOTUS (e.g. processing times can be significantly reduced) and all JASMIN users should aim to utilise this excellent resource for their data processing. This webinar will help show you how to set up and submit jobs to the LOTUS batch processing cluster.\nThe webinar covers:\nWhy use batch compute? Introduction to LOTUS, batch processing and workflows Example 1: a framework for batch workflows Example 2: using job arrays to manage workflows After attending the webinar you should feel confident to:\nSubmit a script as a LOTUS job and view its status Understand the basic command-line options for the batch system Build a batch workflow that can be re-submitted without re-running previously completed tasks Run a set of batch jobs using a job array. See links here for\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;video.\u0026nbsp;\nRecorded on 13th\u0026nbsp;December 2019 for the\u0026nbsp;seventh webinar in a series provided by The Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA). If you have any queries, please email the\u0026nbsp;CEDA helpdesk.\n*LOTUS is a batch processing service on JASMIN which enables efficient submission and scheduling of large-scale and/or resource-intensive processing.

        content: "The 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) is an international coordinated effort to understand how the climate has changed in the past and may change in the future. It is the largest climate model intercomparison project to date and is coming to completion. Data produced by CMIP6 is essential to the 2021 assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CEDA supports CMIP6 by providing archival, management and publication of all received data and providing analysis capabilities through JASMIN.\nCurrently, the CEDA Archive holds approximately three petabytes of CMIP6 data (of a total 20 Petabytes produced across the project). Researchers across the world use these important climate projections to explore topics such as the impact of climate change on hydroelectric power in Kenya, how future temperatures will affect human welfare, and many other important science areas.\nApproximately half of the archived data is from the UK Met Office Hadley Centre, for which CEDA are the primary archive – this allows all international collaborators access to the Met Office model simulations data. The other half of the data is replicated from other contributing modelling centres from around the world. This replication of internationally produced data allows easy access and analysis for the UK research community.\nGraphic showing how the different experiments in the CMIP project link together Figure 1: this shows the continuity between CMIP6 to CMIP7 to CMIPx. Each evolution of the project runs a core set of experiments (the grey thread) and updates the other experiments as climate science evolves. Figure from: Eyring et al. Overview of the CMIP6 Experimental Design and Organization, GMD, 2016.\nSupporting international research \u0026nbsp; CMIP6 data are shared and published to a globally distributed software infrastructure called the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). This is an international collaboration between research institutions that allows the dissemination of outputs from important climate modelling efforts, such as CMIP6. CEDA is responsible for the UK’s contributions to ESGF. We are part of a network of 33 nodes disseminating climate data around the world by providing tools and interfaces for data management, discovery and download.\nCEDA staff are involved with ESGF in various ways, including; developing software components within the international collaboration, leading the design of future architecture, and maintaining operations for our data node as part of the network.\nAutomating processes \u0026nbsp; The sheer volume of data requires the ingestion into the CEDA Archive and subsequent publication to ESGF to be fully automated and flexible enough to work for all incoming data sources. To achieve this, CEDA have developed a dedicated tool called the CEDA REceive-to-Publish Pipeline (CREPP) tool. The tool has successfully been used to publish global climate simulation data of key interest to the climate science community from 30 of the world’s leading climate research institutions.\nFuture architecture for ESGF \u0026nbsp; In 2019, CEDA led a programme of work to re-engineer the ESGF software system that was first developed over ten years ago. The work included the adoption of new technologies to facilitate cloud deployment. Working with US partners, a first system has been deployed on Amazon Web Services. A deployment by CEDA on JASMIN has been used in a new pilot system integrating tools and systems from other European partners. Work is also focussing on the development of new community standards for functions such as data discovery in order to facilitate interoperability and broader adoption of the systems developed."

This guide covers how to edit and update the various sections of the site.\nSite layout \u0026nbsp; Content is organised into the following main sections:\nNews Events Projects About and is written in Markdown format, but with a few extra features provided by both Hugo\u0026nbsp; and the Hinode theme\u0026nbsp; template. It is worth reading the documentation for both of these to understand the syntax fully.\nTwo further links in the site\u0026rsquo;s navbar point to components whose content is managed elsewhere:\nStatus CEDA/JASMIN service status: this page is a single-page section of this site that renders a JSON feed of events, content for which is stored in the ceda-status\u0026nbsp; repository. Techblog an external link to the separately-hosted CEDA TechBlog, maintained here\u0026nbsp; The site uses a system of templates to transform content in markdown format, into a set of static web pages. So all the different views of the site are pre-generated. So instead of there being an \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; interface to edit the website as with previous platforms, editing is done by changing/adding to the source content, or modifying templates or configuration, then re-building the site.\nOverview of publishing process \u0026nbsp; New content gets published when the site is rebuilt. The site gets rebuilt when:\nchanges are pushed or merged to the main branch of the repository on a schedule, once every weekday night. After initial setup, the edit/update process involves:\npulling the latest changes to the site repo into your local copy (VSCode can do this for you) making a branch for your edits making some changes (e.g. adding a new news item) checking that a LOCAL preview of the site looks OK with your changes committing your changes to your branch (in the version of your repo) pushing that branch to the remote repository (Github) checking that a REMOTE preview of the site looks OK with your changes (a remote preview is generated for each branch automatically) creating a pull request to merge that branch into main reviewing the pull request, see roles merging the pull request, see roles waiting for the site to be rebuilt checking that all is OK with the rebuilt live site Roles \u0026nbsp; The following roles are in use for this site (corresponding to groups in our GitHub org). Your GitHub ID needs to be a member of the relevant group(s).\nceda-div-site-authors can create content for review \u0026amp; publication by an editor ceda-div-site-editors can merge changes for publication to the live site Editing a news item \u0026nbsp; Your route to editing a news item will depend on your role:\nAuthors might prefer to create/edit new news items in the GitHub site itself, submitting them for review and publication by an Editor see this process in detail Editors would do the whole process themselves, using a local install of Hugo and Hinode to work on changes to the site, or reviewing and merging changes proposed by an editor. They might ask another Editor to review their own changes. see this process in detail News items are stored in the directory content/news/updates/YYYY where YYYY is the current year.\nThere is a template news item here, which can be copied as an example:\ncontent/news/updates/2024/2024-03-06-an-example-news-item.md\nBut to do this, note the following:\nthe filename should be of the form YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md, where YYYY-MM-DD is the publication date. If the year is 2024, this file should go in the 2024 directory. slug is a CONCISE string representing the title (doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be identical) .md format extension needs to be present, but is not used in the eventual URL of the article Inside the markdown file we have:\n--- title: An example news item date: 2024-03-06 10:30:00 tags: [\u0026#39;news\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ceda\u0026#39;] thumbnail: icon: fas circle-info text-info draft: true # remove this line in your copy --- No need to repeat the title as a heading here. This is an example news item which can be copied to create a new one. ### Here\u0026#39;s a heading Here\u0026#39;s some text (after a spacer line) #### A subheading And some more text, just before the blank line at the end.Looking at the top section first:\nThe \u0026ldquo;Frontmatter\u0026rdquo; or metadata section is at the top of the file, between the separators --- and ---. Hugo allows frontmatter in YAML, TOML or JSON syntax: the separator symbol denotes which: --- is for YAML. For this site, to keep things simple, we\u0026rsquo;ll stick to YAML as used above. There should be a blank line after the separator and before the markdown content, and also at the end of the file (see markdown-source-files). For a full explanation see the documentation on Hinode Frontmatter\u0026nbsp; , but the Frontmatter fields used above (and sufficient for a simple news item) are:\nfield content comment title Title of the post Avoid quotes, ampersands or other symbols, be consistent with capitalisation. Don\u0026rsquo;t repeat the title in the markdown: the template does this for you in list \u0026amp; single views. Add other headings starting with ### Heading3 (because title gets rendered as ## Heading2). date Publication date/time of the post Must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss including the time with seconds. The date part should correspond with the filename. Articles with a date in the future are NOT built, so you can use this to schedule future publication, but only if the site is rebuilt at some point before that date. tags Tags relevant to this post Check first to choose from existing tags or add your own. Take care with typos not to create new ones unnecessarily. thumbnail Optional image for the post An image specified here will be used as the thumbnail for the post in list view, and as a banner across the top of the post in single view. It should exist in a corresponding directory assets/img/YYYY/YYYY-slug/, so you need to create that directory and add that image file in your changes, in order to refer to it. A post should have either an image OR an icon, with the other field left blank icon Optional icon for the post Should be in format \u0026lt;icon-library\u0026gt; \u0026lt;icon-name\u0026gt; text-\u0026lt;colour\u0026gt; using the name of an icon from FontAwesome icons\u0026nbsp; (filtered for \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; ones).\n\u0026lt;icon-library\u0026gt; can be either fa, fab or fas, shorthand for fa-regular, fa-brands or fa-solid.\n\u0026lt;icon-name\u0026gt; should be the name of the icon but witout the fa- prefix.\ntext-\u0026lt;colour\u0026gt; is optional but the \u0026lt;colour\u0026gt; choice is from this site\u0026rsquo;s predefined theme colours, i.e.\nprimary (default) secondary success danger warning info light dark . A post should have either an image OR an icon, with the other field left blank Once the rest of the content of the news item has been written, you\u0026rsquo;re at step 3 of the publishing process, so follow the remainder of the process to get the item published.\nWhat is markdown? \u0026nbsp; Markdown\u0026nbsp; is very lightweight markup language for creating formatted text. It\u0026rsquo;s intended to be easy to read in its basic form, but the Hugo and Hinode systems used here add some additional functionality by using shortcodes and other features, which help specifically in the creation of richly-formatted static websites.\nStyle guidelines \u0026nbsp; We want to keep the site looking smart, engaging and easy to read.\nBy using a well-maintained set of tools and taking care with authoring, reviewing and publishing content on the site, this is now more achievable than with previous platforms, using the tips and guidelines below.\nMarkdown source files \u0026nbsp; VSCode supports editing and preview of markdown files without installing anything new good for a basic, quick view and for proofreading Install and use the David Anson / markdownlint markdown linter for VScode\u0026nbsp; this helps keep markdown content tidy and functional for example: preferred syntax for lists, whitespace, headings, etc. (rather than list all the rules here, use the linter and discover better markdown syntax!) it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support ALL the formatting we might want to use, but we could extend the rule set. Exemptions can be declared (see source for this article, around the example shortcode) Managing the source content using git we have better control of the process Use VSCode\u0026rsquo;s git integrations to help with managing your changes to the site Content \u0026nbsp; General \u0026nbsp; Be concise \u0026#x1f609; Links \u0026nbsp; Use labelled links instead of describing what to do: avoid \u0026ldquo;please follow the link below\u0026rdquo; Use a button \u0026nbsp; to make important links or actions visually distinct In-page links are automatically generated from subheadings (hover to see them), so don\u0026rsquo;t make your own. Use the link\u0026nbsp; shortcode where possible, as this makes it easier to control their appearance throughout the site. But if you can\u0026rsquo;t bothered, the [markdown](#url) format works too. You can link to things by name, slug, url or (if needed) path to the markdown file. See the link documentation for examples. Use a relative link if at all possible, this makes changes to the site easier There\u0026rsquo;s a curated set of frequently-used links (e.g. \u0026quot;ceda_archive\u0026quot;) in config/_default/params.toml: consider adding to this list for frequently-used links: this means they can be used throughout the site but updated in one place if things change. We can create a curated set of abbreviations, stored in data/abbr.yml, for use with the abbr\u0026nbsp; shortcode, for example ceda (hover for details). Images \u0026nbsp; (see Hinode docs\u0026nbsp; )\nHinode has some clever image-formatting features, see Hinode docs\u0026nbsp; for details.\nStore images for a news item post in assets/img/YYYY/YYYY-slug/ and choose one of them as the thumbnail. Others can be referred to in the text using the image shortcode, e.g.\nmarkdown \u0026lt; image src=\u0026#34;img/flowers.jpg\u0026#34; ratio=\u0026#34;3x2\u0026#34; caption=\u0026#34;image caption\u0026#34; \u0026gt; Note that although the image is stored below assets/img, the path starts with img/ for the shortode.

        content: "Climate Change is a defining issue of our time. The UK’s top 10 warmest years have all occurred since 2002, and July 2019 saw the UK’s hottest ever recorded temperature (38.7 °C). Whilst many are enjoying the unusually non-rainy British weather, it doesn’t come without costs. Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and flash flooding, are expected to increase in severity and frequency as our climate continues to change. Extreme weather can adversely affect the way we live our lives. Loss of food production, damaging wildlife habitats, and endangering human life are just a few impacts associated with climate change. Predicting global climate change is complex and requires vast amounts of data processing capabilities. Steps must be taken to improve the accuracy of future climate models. That’s where JASMIN - a data intensive supercomputer - comes in. In order to better predict climate change and thus mitigate against its effects, scientists used JASMIN to analyse data from a new generation of high-resolution global climate models. The PRIMAVERA project allows over 100 scientists from across Europe to work together to process vast numbers of climate simulations. Dr Jon Seddon, a Senior Scientific Software Engineer at the UK Met Office who is working on the project, said: “JASMIN is probably the only facility in Europe (and the world) that would allow PRIMAVERA to do its research. This is because of the large storage capability and the ability for users from multiple institutes across Europe to collaborate where the data is stored”. Two Petabytes of climate simulations were produced by seven different climate models on high performance computers (HPCs) across Europe for use by the project. Transferring large volumes of data between computing facilities can be a time consuming and laborious process. PRIMAVERA needed the data to be transferred to JASMIN so that they could work together to analyse it in a shared workspace. Luckily, JASMIN has a dedicated fast connection to the UK and European research networks - meaning that the data could be efficiently ‘shipped’ to JASMIN, thus allowing the collaboration. JASMIN not only made transferring and sharing the data easy, it also made processing huge amounts of data possible too. Dr Seddon explains how the team used JASMIN’s batch computing cluster to do this. “Due to the large volumes of data processing that we needed to undertake, it was essential that we could test our analyses and then use the parallel processing capability offered by LOTUS on the full 2PB dataset”. Running analyses in parallel can dramatically reduce analysis time - so large complex datasets can now be analysed in record time (i.e. days vs. weeks or months). Once the analyses are complete, the reprocessed datasets are curated, on the CEDA Archive, for long term reuse by other scientists. Dr Seddon explains how other projects not using JASMIN are struggling; “Other projects without access to JASMIN are requiring users to email their analysis code to each of the data providing institutes and then the results are emailed back. This is much slower and much less flexible than users having direct access to the data. The alternative requires a member of staff to store the data on a 10 TB disk and fly with it - not ideal when we are trying to help solve climate change, not contribute to it!”. The scale and complexity of the PRIMAVERA project means that it would not have been possible without JASMIN. As datasets continue to grow and higher resolution climate simulations are modelled, it is essential that computing facilities, like JASMIN, continue to support the needs of the environmental science community. The much higher resolution climate simulations that researchers can now analyse at JASMIN provide a much more detailed look at how the global climate works. Greater resolution datasets are essential for working out how climate change affects society and also allows researchers to make more accurate predictions of the future climate.\nFootnotes:\nJASMIN is managed jointly by STFC\u0026rsquo;s Scientific Computing Department and CEDA (Centre for Environmental Data Analysis), part of RAL Space. It is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). PRIMAVERA is a Horizon 2020 project funded by European Commission under grant agreement no. 641727. The project is a collaboration between 19 European partners, led by the Met Office and the University of Reading in the UK. PRIMAVERA started in November 2015 and runs to the end of July 2020.\nContact: For more information about using JASMIN, please contact our helpdesk\nTo find out more about the PRIMAVERA project, contact the helpdesk and we can put you in touch with the researchers involved"

However, if you only require data which is sytematically available via the internet, you can now follow a simplified and faster procedure: Fast Registration for Category-1 data via the ESA EOPI portal.\nA title and short description of the proposal should be submitted via theÂ website (http://eopi.esa.int) Fast Registration section and once the project proposal has been received, a short review is carried out at ESA.\nYou can use this registration process if the project exclusively requires access to data routinely available via the internet. In any other case the standard Category-1 proposal interface (http://eopi.esa.int/Cat1) must be used to submit a full proposal.\nIf you are unsure whether the data you need fall into this category, you can check the list of products (on the fast registration page) or contact the ESA ESRIN Help and Order Desk.

The federation enables access to Peta-scale scientific data for the purpose of supporting large collaborative projects such as CMIP6 - the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. ESGF is used by scientists around the world to access data, such as CMIP, to study the changing climate. Data from ESGF are ultimately used by government bodies for policy making decisions both at the national and international level such as the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).\nLocations of ESGF partners and collaborators Figure 1: Map of international partners and collaborators for ESGF (Credit: ESGF)\nESGF hold an annual meeting to coordinate the technical development of the system and to discuss, agree and coordinate policies and priorities for the coming year. ESGF has Working Teams, groups which are tasked with tackling a given piece of work for the effort, be it software development or some aspect of operations or security. As part of the annual meeting, the Executive Committee for ESGF, gives awards to teams or individuals that have made a particular achievement in the past year. This year, the Identity, Entitlement and Access (IdEA) team which CEDA staff are members of won an award. The IdEA team work on software solutions for access to restricted data or computing resources. This is an important aspect because for example, data providers may want to record who has accessed their data to report to their sponsors and ensure legitimate fair usage. The IdEA team won the award for rolling out a new system for user sign-in based on OAuth 2.0, a popular framework used throughout the IT industry. The work involved a truly international collaboration with individuals from institutions including the NASA JPL/UCAR, University of Chicago, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and CEDA. Developers Matt Pryor and William Tucker (from CEDA) made key contributions to the software so that it could be easily integrated with existing legacy systems in ESGF.\nIn addition, ESGF as a whole won a prestigious R\u0026amp;D 100 award for 2018 - more information can be found here. You can search for data held on the CEDA archive via the CEDA ESGF search portal.\nIf you have any queries about this service, please contact the CEDA helpdesk and mention ESGF in your query. "

It helps by removing otherwise complex data processing hurdles to data discovery and exploration.\nCEDA was funded by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) to provide leadership and project management for the coordination and development of the ECDE. The ECDE provides novel interactive access to a diverse set of climate impact indices by combining live data from the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS) with visualisations that use the CDS Toolbox.\nECDE data is currently customised for climate indices in the health, agriculture, forestry, energy, tourism and coastal impact sectors. For example, the health sector has climate impact indices about thermal comfort and heatwaves as well as the suitability of Europe’s climate for the tiger mosquito which can transmit diseases, such as dengue fever.\nScreenshot from the European Climate Data Explorer, showing the six climate impact sectors addressed by the ECDE. Image: Screenshot from the European Climate Data Explorer, showing the six climate impact sectors addressed by the ECDE.\nEach climate impact index has two ECDE pages: the first is a Europe-wide visualisation supported by text that provides context for how an index can be understood, the second allows users to explore an index further via an interactive map. The interactive map can be used to focus on smaller regions and to generate time series plots. The visualised data can be exported as images for use in reports and as data files for further analysis.\nMap of a climate impact index from the ECDE\u0026rsquo;s Forestry sector showing the projected change in the number of days per year with high fire danger under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario known as RCP8.5 for the period 2066-2095.

The first webinar is scheduled for 20th March called ‘Further use of Git and GitHub’ - register now!\nWe hope that this will encourage knowledge exchange amongst users and provide more opportunities for you to meet the JASMIN team; rather than just once a year at the JASMIN conference. Our current plan is that the conference will return again in 2020.\nWe will also continue to run events that have a stronger focus on data and the CEDA archive. All details for these events will be published on the main CEDA website, under the training tab (here) and via our social media channels (particularly Twitter).

She wrote us a blog post, take a look below to see what she got up to\u0026hellip; Hi I’m Annsha and I’ve spent this week at CEDA doing work experience. Here’s a brief overview of the tasks I did.\nThis week, I gathered pictures from Sentinel 2a and Sentinel 2b using the CEDA Satellite Data Finder and a software called SNAP. I gathered pictures of the Irish Sea, Mount Etna from an island called Sicily in Italy and the Atlas mountains in Morocco. These pictures were uploaded onto the CEDA twitter page (@cedanews) along with some instructions as to how I got these images and you can find this by following the address: https://twitter.com/cedanews/status/1020232122836058112 (or see images below). I also filled out information for some of the solar images on glass plates. These solar images were taken back in 1903 by the Cambridge Solar Observatory. Digitising this information means that other users will be able to search for these historic images of the sun over a specific period.\nI’ve also attended a few meetings with my supervisor – these showed me what working life involves, but many of the acronyms and project names were confusing!\nI’ve had a lot of fun going on tours around ISIS Neutron and Muon Source where they showed various instruments, shielding for a beam of protons as well as where neutrons would be scattered around. ISIS is a facility mainly used for particle physics but a variety of researchers in universities and industry visit it to aid their research. It was especially exciting to see liquid nitrogen being poured onto the floor, evaporating instantly. On the RAL space tour I saw the Sentinel 5 satellite which is currently being tested, clean rooms and large vacuum chambers where satellites are tested inside to give a Space like environment.\nFinally, I went on a data centre tour where I saw JASMIN, which is used for storage and cloud computing for big data challenges in environmental science. On Friday I also went to a talk on NERC’s Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) which was very interesting. I’ve also talked with lots of different people where I found out what degree they have done and also what their PhD were about.\nI’ve learned a lot from this placement, I’ve seen how physics can be applied to lots of different things in our world, for example, to assist satellites that observe the earth and atmosphere. I’ve also learned that I would like to work in a similar environment to this as it is friendly and relaxed, and surrounded by cutting-edge technology. I’ve enjoyed this experience and I would recommend this to anyone!\nIf you want to find out more about STFC\u0026rsquo;s work experience scheme, see here: https://stfc.ukri.org/about-us/work-with-us/work-experience/ "

Over 1300 flights have collected a wealth of data from across the world.\nWhy is this data useful? \u0026nbsp; There are a huge number of use cases for atmospheric data. Some examples include:\nTracking flight disruption from volcanic eruptions Understanding health implications from human activities, such as cargo ship emissions Reducing uncertainty in climate predictions Improving storm predictions The data includes atmospheric measurements such as:\nMeteorology - e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure, air motion, solar irradiance Chemical composition e.g. greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane Atmospheric chemistry - e.g. soot, aerosols, cloud condensation nuclei Cloud physics - e.g. droplets, particles, water content We need your help! \u0026nbsp; We’ve launched two surveys to gain understanding of the FAAM data user base (both existing and new), and to identify any accessibility barriers and how to overcome them.\nAnyone who has used, or has an interest in using, FAAM data can respond to our surveys:\nExisting users - please fill in this survey Potential new users - please fill in this survey Please share these surveys widely with your communities.\nWe know these data are regularly reused. However, we have a limited understanding of who is using them, what they are doing or would like to do. We do not know whether there are barriers for users engaging with these data.\nWe think that the data collected by the FAAM aircraft may be useful to a broader community e.g. by health researchers. But we do not know who or how they would like to use the data.\nWe want to broaden the user base of data held by the NERC Environmental Data Service (EDS), such as FAAM. To do this, we need to understand who is currently using the data, why and how - whilst also finding out who else is interested in making use of the data.\nThese surveys are the initial steps to increasing our understanding about challenges faced by new and existing data users. We will also be hosting some focus groups/workshops later in the summer to discuss in more detail.\nThis work is being undertaken by members of the NERC Environmental Data Service (EDS) and will help us to improve our data and services.\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us: support@ceda.ac.uk"

        content: "The National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) recently hosted the first-ever symposium for the early career atmospheric science community - Harmony in the Skies: Bridging Horizons in Atmospheric Science. Two CEDA graduates, Jesse Alexander and Nicola Farmer, helped organise the event, which was designed to bring staff early in their atmospheric science careers together.\nThe symposium, which took place at NCAS HQ Fairbairn House in Leeds, was highly successful, with a series of workshops, lightning talks, and discussions. It provided a forum for sharing ideas and insights designed to ensure that the science we do is sustainable and inclusive. Emily Anderson, Graduate Data Scientist said: “The symposium was a great way to meet and network with others at NCAS who are also early in their career. The event was fun and engaging, and it was interesting to hear about the research and work that others in the community are involved in.”\nAll about CEDA and JASMIN \u0026nbsp; “Getting to know NCAS” was a key section of the forum, highlighting different projects that go on at NCAS and helping people get a broader picture of the research and people supporting the research. Jesse Alexander, Scientific Programming and Outreach Graduate, gave an introductory talk about CEDA\u0026nbsp; , explaining the complexities of being the data centre for both atmospheric and earth observation data. The talk spotlighted our key services; JASMIN and the CEDA Archive, whilst promoting the huge range of things we do and the support we can offer to NERC researchers.\nSharing experience in software engineering Nicola Farmer, Graduate Software Engineer, also helped facilitate and deliver computing workshops during the event. The first aimed to build a software and computing community connecting different strands of the atmospheric science community. The other provided a space for discussing important practices and exploring important technologies or resources available to the computing community. Nicola also talked about the benefits of containerisation using Docker, highlighting that containers are lightweight and portable, meaning they can be quickly set up and shut down on any system.\nNicola demonstrated how to use containers during the workshop, showcasing that they are isolated from the system meaning they can run without having to install software or worry about compatibility issues. You can click here to access the entire presentation from this software and data best practices workshop\u0026nbsp; . Ellie Fisher, Graduate Data Scientist said “It was nice to have a spotlight on the software alongside the science as this is very relevant to my work at CEDA!”\nAutomated data cataloguing \u0026nbsp; A CEDA industrial placement student, Rory Jenns, discussed how he enabled automation and improvements to the CEDA arrivals service\u0026nbsp; , highlighting the complexities of data management along the way. You can view his presentation slides here\u0026nbsp; .\nRory presenting during Day 2 of the NCAS Early Career Symposium About the event, Rory said: “It was invigorating to hear how passionate the researchers across NCAS are about climate change, its impacts and how we can reduce them. From tracking methane leaks to modelling aerosols in the atmosphere to analysing weather patterns in the Indian Ocean, the breadth and depth of research is incredible. I loved getting a sense of the work we support at CEDA.”\nDuring Rory’s talk, he walked us through the process of ingesting datasets into the Archive and how, through his work, data can now be uploaded, ingested, and catalogued automatically. Getting new data to the CEDA Catalogue\u0026nbsp; quickly and reliably.\nCloud-optimised data formats \u0026nbsp; Graduate Software Engineer, Dan Westwood, gave an engaging talk about the cloud-optimised data formats Kerchunk and Zarr and how they can be used to optimise data storage and access. You can click here to access his presentation slides\u0026nbsp; . He explains the difficulties with storing pure NetCDF files on JASMIN and how it can be restrictive for data analysis across different sites and applications. To find out more about this click here to check out Dan’s Pipeline to Aggregate Data for Optimised Cloud Capabilities (Padocc).\u0026nbsp; Dan and Rory then took part in an open panel discussion where they answered questions posed by the attendees. It was evident how keen people were to learn about best practices for data storage and representation, as well as top tips for uploading data into our arrivals service.\nSupporting early careers is a strategic priority at CEDA. We currently have six Graduates, two Apprentices, and two Industrial Placement students with more on the way. It’s therefore no surprise that we had a great turnout at the symposium, with 8 delegates from CEDA we made up more than a fifth of the event attendees!\nThere are plans to make this an annual event, with the next symposium pencilled in for January 2025."

        description: "Adrian Dębski, holder of 3 European and 13 Polish ‘speed-cubing’ records, joined the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) for his Year in Industry as part of his BSc Computer Science degree at Aberystwyth University in August 2022.",
        
        
        content: "Adrian Dębski, holder of 3 European and 13 Polish ‘speed-cubing’ records, joined the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) for his Year in Industry as part of his BSc Computer Science degree at Aberystwyth University in August 2022. During his time with us he amazed us with not only his prowess of solving Rubik\u0026rsquo;s cubes in less than 10s (blindfolded!) but also in how well he became a team member and helped enhance CEDA’s service deliveries. As Adrian left us to head over to Seoul for his next speed cubing world championships we caught up with him to reflect on his time with us.\nSoftware and tools underpin CEDA’s service delivery to the wider science community. Whether that is associated with our JASMIN data analysis system or the vast CEDA data archives. During his year Adrian worked on a variety of tasks aimed at enhancing some of these key services to raise the standard of services provided by CEDA, providing him with a wide range of experience and knowledge across all parts of the software development lifecycle and made a real impact improving CEDA’s services.\nEnvironmental data held in the CEDA archives are highly heterogeneous and with over 350 million files search tools are a vital aspect of our service delivery. For CEDA this takes the shape of our comprehensive data catalogue - but as detailed as the content may be, without decent search functionality users can find it hard to find the data they really need… Thankfully, Adrian took this need onboard and completely rewrote the catalogue’s search functionality, bringing better indexing and search results alongside a wider range of search options. We are confident our users will benefit from this much improved aspect of our catalogue.\nAdrian has had to quickly pick up new abilities and experiences along the way in order to accomplish this remarkable feat, he explains:\n“It was a great feeling and huge satisfaction to improve the quality of the catalogue. Before I looked into it, I heard about the complaints this service would receive on a regular basis: about how slow and inconvenient it was and its poor search results. Exploring the code and documentation to understand everything and develop a new approach was a great hands-on experience… as was talking to data scientists, listening to their stories, figuring out the actual use-cases of the wider user community, and developing something that really delivers improvements for actual users! I have learnt so much about cooperation and also developed my approach to problem solving and coding.”\nAdrian also helped us to move one of our older services - the CEDA Document Repository - over from an in-house hosted service to the CERN operated Zenodo service. This required careful and detailed handling of the content, but Adrian rose to the challenge to ensure CEDA were able to make this transition not only with zero impact on end-users, but actually helping to enhance the content along the way! You can find out more about this migration over on our techincal blog.\nScreenshot of document repository that Adrian helped to improve During his time with us, team members were impressed by Adrian\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;can-do\u0026rdquo; attitude as well as his remarkable intuition, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills. With more twists and turns that a Rubik\u0026rsquo;s cube solution, his hard work and overall involvement has been appreciated by his colleagues here in CEDA, and we were delighted to offer him a place on the STFC Graduate Scheme next year with us with additional sponsorship for his 3rd year of studies.\nThough Adrian may not have clear plan for his future career at this stage, he sees how time with CEDA can help him explore his options and provide opportunities to develop:\n“The chance to join CEDA again via the STFC graduate scheme is a great opportunity for me - I look forward to the new challenges it will provide to continue to improve my software developer skills within an exciting and inspiring scientific environment. Knowing the scheme will also provide me with the chance to work with other teams across STFC and CEDA’s other partner organisations will mean I’m sure to have the opportunities to try out a range of other working environments too.”\nWe wish Adrian all the best in his final year of studies and are delighted to know we’ll see him again in September 2024! Thanks for all your hard work this year Adrian and all the very best for the World Speed Cubing Championship in Seoul this summer!"

The conference​ focussed on addressing the opportunities in understanding vast datasets and assessing ways to take that new information and make it useable to the widest variety of disciplines for societal benefit and commercial growth.\nVast datasets now exist in many areas of science and society but we need the right tools to process and make sense of it. PV2018 highlighted the cutting edge of this data exploitation and preservation work. Esther Conway, Head of the Scientific Programme Committee for PV2018 and Senior Data Scientist at CEDA, welcomed delegates to the conference “We\u0026rsquo;re delighted to bring the PV2018 conference to the UK. The way we manage large datasets underpins our ability to do big science. We have speakers from across the world sharing their projects to help realise the social and economic benefits of data. It\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic opportunity to forge new international partnerships and strengthen existing ones.\u0026quot;\nOver 310 authors from five continents contributed, talks ranged from pest control in sub-Saharan Africa to the UK transport network. The programme featured speakers from NASA, CERN, ESA, the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA), Chinese meteorological office and Kenyan Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation as well as British institutions.\nCEDA staff presented work at the conference including; Phil Kershaw, Technical Manager, who presented two talks; one about JASMIN and another about developing an Open Data Portal for ESA’s Climate Change Initiative. While CEDA Data Scientist’s, Charlotte Pascoe and Alison Pamment spoke about ‘The Data Distribution Centre of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’ and ‘Building an Infrastructure for Climate Model Archives’. All talks from the conference are now available to view here.\nOne of the innovative UK projects presented at the conference was the Pest Risk Information Service (PRISE). Funded by the UK Space Agency International Partnership Programme (IPP), to develop a crop pest and disease risk forecasting system designed for smallholders and commercial producers in developing countries. Bringing together a broad range of stakeholders, including plant protection authorities, data experts, private sector companies, and the farmers themselves, PRISE uses state-of-the-art crop and pest modelling techniques to provide users with advanced warning of a damaging outbreak and appropriate advice on mitigation responses. PRISE are collaborating with CEDA and utilising JASMIN for their project.\nBeth Greenaway, Head of Earth Observations and Climate at the UK Space Agency, said: “It is a pleasure to welcome this conference to the UK Space Gateway at Harwell. We generate so much fantastic data now from cutting-edge Earth observation missions. It\u0026rsquo;s vital for the community who really know how to manage and preserve the data to talk with those who will be using it for applications we haven\u0026rsquo;t even thought of yet. This conference provides a space for key discussion at a time of rapid change in the Earth observation sector, with many smaller and cheaper missions evolving as well as users waking up to the potential.\u0026quot;\nWhile the PRISE project is all about combining readily available data and making it accessible to the people who need it, the same challenges are being faced by the team behind the UK Data Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure (DAFNI). This new UK national facility will enable researchers and policy makers to understand and predict stresses and strains on UK infrastructure. As our society and environment changes so our infrastructure, from energy suppliers, water systems and transport routes, must adapt. This project will enable smarter investment and better planning for extreme events for more resilient infrastructure. Scheduled to be operational in 2021, conference delegates heard from STFC\u0026rsquo;s Scientific Computing Department (SCD) about what it takes to design such a sophisticated system.\nOther talks demonstrated how machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the way scientists work. The BACI project has perfected machine learning to automate methods to detect changes to ecosystems using satellite data. It has used JASMIN, a supercomputer and data store for environmental science, managed jointly by CEDA and SCD, to process almost 20 years of EO data for use in biodiversity and land use studies. Growing quantities of data make this kind of AI system vital to our understanding of the planet.\nJohn Remedios, Director of NCEO said “The PV conference provides a window on a worldwide development of advanced computing, data-driven methods and space which is set to fuel a new information economy based around observing our planet. Historically, advances in public and commercial information has been closely allied to step changes in computing and methods, for example in environmental science and weather forecasting. The new exploitation of data science is potentially such a step change. The JASMIN facility hosting satellite data next to processing is a leading research infrastructure for the UK in this arena.\u0026quot;\nNow in its ninth edition, PV addresses prospects in the domain of data preservation, stewardship and value adding of scientific data and research related information.​​ STFC RAL Space ( including CEDA), the UK Space Agency and the National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) hosted the conference bringing together participants from academia and industry.\nPresentation slides from the conference are now available here."

        content: "In 2019 the CEDA Archive published a valuable and popular HadUK-Grid dataset collection. This collection, provided by the Met Office contains gridded climate variables derived from the network of UK land surface observations, particularly notable in that it spans a long time-series. Over the last few months the Met Office have been preparing the latest release of the HadUK-Grid data covering 1862-2019 and has now been made freely available to download from the CEDA Archive service.\nSome of the observations underwent a ‘rescue mission’ where they were digitised from historic weather station records. These observations have been collated to generate values on a regular grid from the irregular station network, taking into account factors such as latitude and longitude, altitude and terrain shape, coastal influence, and urban land use. Variables include air temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, mean sea level pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, vapour pressure, days of snow lying, and days of ground frost.\nThe density of the station network used varies through time, and for different climate variables — for example, for the temperature variables the number of stations rises from about 270 in the 1910s to 600 in the mid-1990s, before falling to 450 in 2006. The station observations used to produce the grids have undergone a quality control process which corrects or removes erroneous data. The gridded data sets are based on the archive of UK weather observations held at the Met Office.\nDetails of the particular improvements in v1.0.2.1 over previous versions are available on the assocaited CEDA data catalogue records and within summary change log files now available in the archive alongside the data.\nThe primary purpose of these data are to facilitate monitoring of UK climate and research into climate change, impacts and adaptation. Data can be accessed here and more information can be found on the Met Office website. More information about why these data are of particular use is available on the original news item when these data were first release in 2018. The data have been created by the Met Office with financial support from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in order to support the Public Weather Service Customer Group (PWSCG), the Hadley Centre Climate Programme, and the UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) project. The data recovery activity to supplement 19th and early 20th Century data availability was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC grant ref: NE/L01016X/1) project \u0026ldquo;Analysis of historic drought and water scarcity in the UK\u0026rdquo;."

        content: "NASA satellite observations have provided the first evidence the rate of ozone depletion in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s upper atmosphere is decreasing. This may indicate the first stage of ozone layer recovery.\nFrom an analysis of ozone observations from NASA\u0026rsquo;s first and second Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) satellite instruments, scientists have found less ozone depletion in the upper stratosphere (22-28 miles altitude) after 1997. The American Geophysical Union Journal of Geophysical Research has accepted a paper for publication on these results.\nThis decrease in the rate of ozone depletion is consistent with the decline in the atmospheric abundance of man-made chorine and bromine-containing chemicals that have been documented by satellite, balloon, aircraft and ground based measurements.\nConcerns about ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere or stratosphere led to ratification of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer by the international community in 1987. The protocol restricts the manufacture and use of human-made, ozone-depleting compounds, such as chlorofluorocarbons and halons.\n\u0026ldquo;Ozone is still decreasing but just not as fast,\u0026rdquo; said Mike Newchurch, associate professor at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, Ala., and lead scientist on the study. \u0026ldquo;We are still decades away from total ozone recovery. There are a number of remaining uncertainties such as the effect of climate change on ozone recovery. Hence, there is a need to continue this precise long-term ozone data record,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;This finding would have been impossible had either SAGE II or HALOE not lasted so long past their normal mission lifetime,\u0026rdquo; said Joe Zawodny, scientist on the SAGE II satellite instrument science team at NASA\u0026rsquo;s Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va.\nSAGE II is approaching the 19th anniversary of its launch, and HALOE has been returning data for 11 years. Scientists also used international ground networks to confirm these data from satellite results.\nSAGE I was launched on the Applications Explorer Mission-B spacecraft in 1979; the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite carried SAGE II into orbit in 1984. The Space Shuttle Discovery carried HALOE into space on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 1991.\nNASA\u0026rsquo;s Earth Science Enterprise funded this research in an effort to better understand and protect our home planet. The ozone layer protects the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface from the sun\u0026rsquo;s harmful ultraviolet rays. Ultraviolet radiation can contribute to skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harm other animals and plants. Ozone depletion in the stratosphere also causes the ozone hole that occurs each spring over Antarctica.\nFor information about NASA\u0026rsquo;s Earth Science Entreprise on the internet, visit: http://www.earth.nasa.gov.\nFor information about the HALOE data held at the BADC, visit: http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/haloe/.\nFor information about the SAGE II data held at the BADC, visit: http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/sage2/.\nNASA, 29th July 2003"

        content: "Five years ago today, an initial 4.5 petabytes of high-performance storage was brought online, signalling the ‘birth’ of JASMIN and revolutionising access to environmental science data for NERC. JASMIN is half super-computer and half data-centre and provides a globally unique platform at STFC, hosted for computing and storing UK and European environmental science data.\nA bustling hub of scientific collaboration, JASMIN has nearly 150 NERC-related science projects using its group workspaces and the CEDA archive. These workspaces bring together researchers from across the domains of data-intensive environmental science.\nAround 1000 virtual machines and 5000 cores of computing power are woven together with a fast internal network; which efficiently moves petabytes of data around, into, and out of JASMIN every month. Today, JASMIN’s storage capacity has tripled to over 16 petabytes - as a comparison, 1 petabyte of average length songs would equate to approximately 2000 years of continuous play!\nAlready, JASMIN has established its own ‘data gravity’ - the ability of data to attract additional applications and services. Research projects benefit (and in many cases have only become feasible) from locating their analysis activities alongside the CEDA archive and other resources, so that they can share their work efficiently with colleagues and other projects alike. Meanwhile the JASMIN cloud has evolved to enable projects to showcase their work via outward-facing services which they maintain themselves.\nThe UPSCALE project is a great example of how complex science questions were able to be answered via the use of JASMIN; processing time for climate model analysis was reduced from 3 months to merely 24 hours - the size and scale of this project would not have been possible without JASMIN.\nJASMIN now has over 1200 users from a variety of scientific backgrounds and levels of expertise. Over 100 (mostly doctoral) students register to use JASMIN every year; with around 2000 more registering each year to exploit data via the CEDA download services. A variety of training courses are provided by the CEDA and JASMIN teams, to help users manage, access and visualise data.\nOver the last five years, JASMIN has enabled a vibrant and dynamic UK research community to do new and exciting science. Significant but exciting challenges lie ahead, as the NERC community’s demand for JASMIN’s data storage and computing continues to grow.\nHappy 5th Birthday JASMIN!\nThe CEDA and STFC Scientific Computing Department teams"

        content: "The Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) needs to keep users and stakeholders informed of the latest developments, but also evidence the impact of its services (i.e. the CEDA archive, JASMIN) to its funders. To help do this we have created a new role within the CEDA team; meet our Communications Manager, Poppy Townsend. Poppy is now responsible for our external communications to users, such as social media and website content, as well as working out how best to measure our impact.\nAlongside her day job, Poppy is undertaking a part-time MSc in Science Communication at UWE Bristol, where her dissertation is investigating how CEDA can evidence its importance for enabling scientific research. In the past, this has been done by irregularly collecting ‘impact stories’ from researchers who use our services. The term ‘impact stories’ is just our name for a short case study or news item about a piece of impactful research that relied upon CEDA services for its success. We define impactful research as anything that caused beneficial changes to occur in the real world (beyond the world of researchers). Examples of previous impact stories include; using Sentinel data in the CEDA archive for long-term earthquake monitoring, using JASMIN for modelling volcanic plumes (see images below). We want to find out how we can best collect these stories in an easy and useful process. For this to work, we need to talk to our key user communities i.e. you! Poppy has already undertaken 6 focus groups at the JASMIN conference, NCAS staff meeting and the Atmospheric Science conference - thanks to all who participated! These provided detailed discussions into why, what, how, when and who to collect impact information from. The output has already proved useful and has been fed into a survey which has been emailed out to a large sample of users in our database.\nIf you’ve received this email please fill it in, it’ll only take 10 minutes! If you didn’t receive an email, then you can fill in the survey here. The results from this research will really help us to shape the new process of collecting impact stories! Poppy’s project aims to provide an easy set of guidelines for CEDA (and other service providers) to utilise when collecting impact stories in the future. And with input from you, our users, we hope that this will make the process of collecting impact stories smoother and more useful for everyone involved.\nUltimately by developing this process, it will help increase our evidence base about CEDA’s impact on researchers (and wider society). Without this evidence, we may not receive funding to continue providing and improving our services.\nMore information about the survey can be found here: https://goo.gl/BXHqEY The survey closes on 17th August at 4.30pm. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. You may ask for your contribution to be withdrawn from the study at any time before the end of August 2018 as long as you submit a memorable word at the end of the survey. All data will be treated as personal under the 2018 GDPR regulations and will be stored securely.\nIf you would like more information on the study, to withdraw your data (before the 31st August 2018) or to see a summary of the findings please contact Poppy Townsend (email poppy.townsend@stfc.ac.uk or telephone 01235 446252)."

        content: "JASMIN is a large and multi-faceted research facility that continues to grow in response to demand from growing numbers of users from a wide range of academic communities. Helping users get the most out of JASMIN is an important part of our remit. Here we highlight four different activities that have been undertaken by the JASMIN team in 2020.\nPROVIDING MULTIPLE PYTHON ENVIRONMENTS WITH JASPY \u0026nbsp; JASMIN users have a range of software requirements, from very basic python scripts through to full-blown data analysis packages. We have developed Jaspy, a software toolkit for managing and installing python and non-python packages on JASMIN. This toolkit provides software environments of common packages on the scientific analysis servers and LOTUS cluster. This allows users to use multiple environments simultaneously, which is particularly useful for researchers undertaking long-running studies that require a consistent software environment.\nMIGRATION TO CENTOS7 ON JASMIN \u0026nbsp; The operating system used across the many hundreds of servers in JASMIN was approaching end-of-life (November 2020). It was essential to move to a new operating system - called CentOS7 - however, this involved moving; servers used to provide user access to JASMIN, servers enabling users to work interactively (sci), servers used to host web-based services, LOTUS batch processing cluster and many more! With careful planning and communication, the switch was completed whilst minimizing disruption to users. JASMIN user documentation was updated to refer to the new resources, alongside new training materials developed to support users.\nJASMIN NOTEBOOK SERVICE \u0026nbsp; Jupyter Notebooks has seen a rise in popularity amongst the research community, for sharing code and data and performing data visualisation. The new JASMIN Notebook service provides access to Jupyter Notebooks in the web browser, allowing users to produce visualisations and interact with them in a much faster feedback loop than was previously possible. The JASMIN Notebook service grants direct access to the CEDA Archive and Group Workspaces providing a collaborative environment enabling research and training materials.\nDELIVERING HANDS-ON WORKSHOPS TO OUR USER COMMUNITY \u0026nbsp; Spending time delivering workshops, webinars and training to our users is an essential part of the work we do. We believe well-trained users will put less pressure on the helpdesk team and spend less time on ‘getting started’ tasks. Ultimately meaning users can spend more time doing their science and will be less likely to inadvertently ‘break’ the services due to inexperience. We have developed a hands-on interactive training event that consists of scenario-based exercises that encourage good practice for using JASMIN. Workshop participants learn how to use JASMIN efficiently to suit their individual workflows.\nAs JASMIN’s demand continues to grow we will endeavour to continue improving and updating our provision of training opportunities in order to best support our user community. All of the work in this article is covered in more detail in our latest Annual Report (19-20), find it here. "

        content: "JASMIN continues to grow as a unique collaborative analysis environment for an expanding community of scientists. We have attempted to address some big challenges, such as the ever-growing demand for storage space and the increasing diversity of scientific workflows, with the Phase 4 upgrade. However, we’re aware that some aspects of the changes introduced in Phase 4 have presented some challenges in themselves. Therefore, we have put together some new documentation about the challenges and summarised what can be done to help deal with them.\nMost of the solutions require help from you, our user community, to ensure best practice for the new storage is followed. There are now four different types of storage, each optimised for different scientific workflows.\nIf everyone can make the required changes to their personal workflows, then it will help improve JASMIN performance for all users. Please take some time to familiarise yourself with the documentation listed below, which explains the challenges/solutions in detail:\nUnderstanding new JASMIN storage - this gives information about the new storage and what workflows work best for each technology.\nNew storage FAQs and issues - this describes specific common known issues, with some suggested solutions.\nAccess to storage - this is an older document, but it gives a good overview on how to use JASMIN storage.\nWe will continue to update these documents when new issues or solutions are found. If you are still experiencing difficulties or slow performance (after checking the documentation) and are unsure why, then contact our helpdesk being sure to include this specific information (also listed below) which will help us answer your query more efficiently."

        content: "Last July the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) welcomed Kate Winfield, who joined us for her Year In Industry as part of her BSc Geography degree at Coventry University. During this time she has experienced all aspects of life as an environmental data scientist and has had some high flying experiences too!\nDuring her time with CEDA, Kate’s plethora of tasks were centred around a major review and overhaul of CEDA’s data catalogue and all other aspects of data curation. From data reformatting and ingestion and developing user friendly support materials, Kate has helped to safeguard and enhance CEDA’s long term data archives.\nKate outside FAAM aircraft, ready for take-off CEDA archives over 183 million files of complex and highly heterogeneous environmental data. Ensuring users can easily discover, browse, understand and use this vast wealth of information relies on a comprehensive and detailed data catalogue. Before Kate started in 2015 CEDA’s data catalogue structure had been updated to meet international standards, but only 21% of the 3000 dataset records fit for purpose, correctly describing and linked to data in the archive. Now, thanks to Kate’s hard work, dedication and plenty of “data archaeology”, over 98% of the 3600 dataset catalogue records are correct and cover almost the entire CEDA archive!\nTo achieve this amazing feat, Kate has had to quickly develop new skills and experiences along the way:\n“It has been an incredible experience supporting and meeting the academic science community. I have really enjoyed exploring and looking at all different types of environmental data from log books to satellite images, from observations to model runs. I have learnt so much in a year including technical skills, such as Python programming, to soft skills like communication.”\nA key part of Kate\u0026rsquo;s year was to provide her with exposure to the wider research community that CEDA supports. As well as attending research meetings and conferences, a real highlight for Kate was a chance to be on a FAAM atmospheric research aircraft flight in March - a wonderful opportunity for her as she readily admits: Kate and Poppy Townsend during FAAM aircraft flight “It was an amazing experience to be able to engage with our data providers and see where fundamental data for CEDA comes from. Watching how the instrument scientists operate instruments and how the scientists are able to quality check the data before it is processed and delivered to CEDA was a real eye opener. I have learnt so much this year and it is an experience I will never forget.”\nNot only has CEDA been thoroughly impressed by the quality and volume of Kate’s work, but STFC have too - awarding her a staff recognition award in March. Her work has also been celebrated at a national level as a finalist in the YINI Contribution to Business awards, achieving the runner-up for the IT award, which was no mean task:\nKate and her YINI finals competiton exhibition stand “It was a really thrilling experience, I never thought I would end up in the finals. I had to present my contribution in 5 minutes to 100 people, including top industry representatives and TV presenter Jon Tickle from Brainiac!”\nKate answering questions after her presentation at the YINI finals But Kate’s hard work also goes back to Coventry with her, having achieved a well deserved 86% (1st) for her university placement coursework, towards her final degree. As Kate returns to her studies in September she takes with her many happy memories, skills and experiences to share with staff and students, which we are confident will inspire others to follow her lead and reach similar heights too.\nAs she leaves us Kate’s final reflection on her experiences and her future is that she wants to continue pursuing a career in environmental science and would love to come back to work at STFC CEDA in the future.\nGood luck Kate; and thank you from all at CEDA - you will be greatly missed by all of the team!"

        content: "The Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) has evolved over time as its remit has changed and developed in response to the needs of its user community. The following gives a brief history of this evolution and a timeline of significant changes.\nThe original \u0026ldquo;CEDA\u0026rdquo; group followed the merger of two of NERC\u0026rsquo;s data centres - the BADC and NEODC - in 2005, originally being called the Centre for Environmental Data Archival. However, with greater support for users analysing the data too a slight name change from the A in CEDA from Archival to Analysis occurred in 2015 to reflect this growing and important role for CEDA.\nPrior to 2005 CEDA\u0026rsquo;s history was that as the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC), with \u0026ldquo;CEDA\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;s 20th anniversary being celebrated in 2015. Sam Pepler also put together a presentation about CEDA\u0026rsquo;s evolution\u0026nbsp; during this time which was presented at the 10th International Digital Data Curation conference in 2015.\nThe BADC was established in 1994 when it superseded a previous facility: the Geophysical Data Facility (GDF). The GDF was previously funded by the then Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) and primarily supported what was then called the \u0026ldquo;upper atmosphere\u0026rdquo; remote sensing community (based as it was on studies of the atmosphere between 10 and 400km). However a survey of the NERC community (Carruthers and Thornes, 1995: Development of the Atmospheric Science and Technology Implementation Plan), resulted in an increased remit for the newly renamed BADC to support the entire NERC atmospheric science community. Over the last decade, it has become apparent that the BADC provides services to a wider community than just the atmospheric sciences community (e.g. medicine, biology, waste management, marine sciences, ecology, etc\u0026hellip;)\nA timeline of important CEDA events is detailed below:\nDevelopment of Geophysical Data Facility (GDF) Begins July 1, 1984\nAn Advisory Panel (of representatives from a wide range of interested institutions and universities) is set up to oversee the development of the Geophysical Data Facility (GDF) and a number of pilot studies are being undertaken. The GDF is to be set-up to organise and provide access to data from many Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Geophysical experiments in the Middle Atmosphere, Climate, Solar Terrestrial and Planetary research.\nGeophysical Data Facility Established August 1, 1985\nThe GDF main aim is to facilitate data exchange to ease the problem of magnetic tape handling which is becoming a severe burden. During the year, data from the NIMBUS series of satellites and Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer (AMPTE) have been consolidated into databases on the IBM central computer. These include measured values of temperature of the middle atmosphere and of density, temperature, pressure and energy spectra of electrons and ions in the magnetosphere. A user at a remote site can access catalogues of the data holdings, select data of interest and transfer these to his own installation via JANET.\nLIMS data on NIMBUS-7 aquired September 1, 1987\nThe general interface to the GDF is improved considerably primarily to help and encourage users. By providing cross links to other geophysical datasets at RAL, datasets from different sources can be readily combined. High level command instructions and graph plotting routines are now also available to aid data manipulation.\nOptical Disk provides rapid access to 40gb of data on a microVAX3900 cluster October 1, 1989\nData now available from the GDF include ground-based and satellite observations from the UK and abroad as well as modelling results from intercomparison and testing measurements. The datasets now include in-situ space plasma data from AMPTE and stratospheric results from SAMS (Stratospheric And Mesospheric Sounder), LIMS and SSU (Stratospheric Sounder Unit) and output from thermospheric and atmospheric models. Solar terrestrial data from the World Data Centre at RAL are also accessible through the GDF environment.\nNew datasets archived November 1, 1990\nThese include the MST radar data, the Cambridge D computer model output and 3 NASA aircraft campaigns which studies ozone depletion processes (AAOE, AASE)\nHigh-speed transatlantic link becomes available December 1, 1991\nThis link is used by RAL mainly for data transfer from the UARS Central Data Handling Facility at NASA\u0026rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center. GDF now serves over 135 users from 22 university departments, 11 other British institutes and 5 overseas laboratories.\nSERC is replaced by Engineering and Physical Sciences research Council (EPSRC) February 1, 1993\nFunding for the GDF is now from NERC, the Natural Environment Research Council. First Edition of the GDF Newsletter\nGDF becomes the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) November 1, 1994\nBADC becomes NERC\u0026rsquo;s Designated Data Centre for the Atmospheric Sciences - \u0026ldquo;Meeting the data requirements of the NERC Atmospheric Science Community\u0026rdquo;\nNERC Met Office Data Agreement October 1, 1996\nA formal agreement was reached between the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Met Office in which all future requests to the Met Office for data intended for NERC-funded atmospheric research will be coordinated by the BADC. This arrangement avoids duplicate requests for data. A strategy of bulk purchasing is in place, benefiting the wider research community in the long term. The BADC pro-actively organises the bulk acquisition of popular datasets. Examples include ECMWF model analyses and Met Office upper-air and surface data.\nCD-ROM juke box installed allowing browsing over the web September 1, 1997\nFollowing the NERC-UKMO agreement, upper air and surface data from the Met Office are being archived at the BADC together with the ECMWF operational analyses (approx. 697GB)\nLaunch of the new BADC web site August 1, 1999\nWebsite includes the new BADC Trajectory service, Met Office stations catalogue, Datasets catalogue and a browsing archive facility (with frames). Explosion in data archive holdings; GOME, virtem, MRF, ozone climatology, worldwide standard radiosonde data, UK high resolution radiosonde data, Met Office Hadley Centre data including GISST and CET, ECMWF trajectory data, Met Office raingauge data from MIDAS, SOAPEX\nBADC Takes over the developmet and maintenence of CAST from the University of Leeds July 1, 2000\nFile ingestor in full operation allowing for UTLS and URGENT (NERC thematic programmes) data files to populate the archive. Unified Model data being archived at the BADC, ESA Water vapour, Meteosat images.\nBADC becomes part of the Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) June 1, 2002\nWork on the Live-Access Server (LAS) facility is under way. this facility will allow users to visualize and subset data via their web browser. This will make possible for users to examine data interactively at BADC without having to download large amounts of data. The BADC now holds over 70 different datasets (approx. 3520 GBs).\nFirst FAAM flight March 1, 2004\nThe BADC archives and distributes data collected onboard the NERC/MO jointly run FAAM aircraft. The BADC has moved from a system based primarily on a central multiprocessor Compaq-Alpha (tornado) to a distributed system based on multiple linux platforms and network attached storage. Total disk storage is currently about 30 TB.\nBADC and NEODC join forces May 1, 2005\nThe BADC is authorised by the European Space Agency to archive and distribute data from 4 Envisat instruments (MIPAS, SCIAMACHY, GOMOS, MERIS) to ESA Category 1 grant holders, in addition to UTLS and CWVC participants.\nBADC takes over the hosting of the IPCC Data Distribution Centre Website. April 1, 2007\nCouncil for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC) and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) merged to form the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).\nCEDA Repository Launched November 1, 2008\nData Extractor available for MIDAS Surface Data.

The stratospheric analyses were produced by a research data assimilation from October 1991, and from October 1995 the research system was replaced by a similar system which was run as part of the operational suite. \u0026#34; The new 3DVAR assimilation went operational on 14th November this year. Output from the new system is now available at the BADC for scientific research, in the same format as output from the current system. \u0026#34;The major changes are: * The introduction of the 3D variational data assimilation scheme. This is described by the recent paper by Lorenc et al, 2000 (Quart. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc., 126, 2992-3012). * The assimilation of radiances, rather than temperature retrievals, from polar orbiter satellites. * The use of a new model configuration, with 40 (rather than 42) levels; this is closer to what is used in the standard global forecast model. Preliminary trials of the new data assimilation system have indicated that the analysed fields in the troposphere and lower stratosphere are similar to those from the current system. Objective forecast verification scores have indicated significant benefit from the change from AC (with assimilation of retrievals) to the use of 3DVAR (with radiance assimilation). In the upper stratosphere the changes are more marked: the stratopause is typically 10 K warmer than in the current system, with the uppermost levels cooler. These latter changes are are largely a reversal of biases that were introduced inadvertently in January 1999 when the ozone climatology file was changed incorrectly.\u0026#34; A new filename convention has been adopted to differentiate the output files from the new 3DVAR assimilation scheme and the data files from the previous AC data assimilation system. Hence ppassm_operf_y.._m.._d.._h...pp becomes ppassm_operg_y.._m.._d.._h...pp At the BADC, the new data files can be found in the current year assimilated data directory: /badc/ukmo-assim/data/standard/2000/ The Assimilated data documentation on the BADC Web pages will be updated shortly.

The primary purpose of scratch storage is for intermediate storage for batch processing jobs on LOTUS. To “police” this, and to preserve the availability of scratch space for all LOTUS users, automated processes will be run at weekly intervals to purge all data older than 28 days.\nWe are also taking this opportunity to adopt the naming convention ‘pw’ and ‘nopw’ to help users distinguish between “parallel write” (pw) and “no parallel write” (nopw) capabilities of these volumes.

So please read on anyway, as this is likely to affect you in the near future.\nISSUE\nAs currently configured, the new SOF storage does not support parallel writes.\nAttempts to write to the same file from different concurrent processes will fail with wider consequences\nThese failures can cause storage volumes to become stuck, leaving the affected files unable to be closed and causing the volume and often the affected host to become locked, requiring a reboot to rectify the situation.\nIt is possible for certain storage volumes to be configured to allow this capability, but with significant costs.\nACTION\nPlease can ALL users check their code, scripts, and particularly any workflow logic used to create logs and output files, to avoid the situation where a file is open for writing by more than 1 process at the same time. This includes use of the MPI-IO library (but please ask for advice in this case. Some uses are ok)\nA common cause of this is writing log files for multiple jobs run on LOTUS to the same file.\nTo avoid this the template “%J” can be used to help create per-job log file names, where %J is replaced by the JobID number. But if you are using job arrays then you must also use “%I” to refer to the individual job array element number in the log or output file name.\nIn more detail:\nThe log file names are specified using the -o and -e options (given on the bsub command line or in #BSUB lines in the script), for job standard output and standard error respectively.\na) Multiple distinct jobs might use the same -o option \u0026ndash; so the user should include %J unless they are confident that they are using a separate output file for each job. [this also applies to job arrays]\nEg. “bsub -o mylogfile.o -e myerrfile.e ” becomes “bsub -o mylogfile.%J.o -e myerrfile.%J.e” where %J is replaced by the LSF jobID number.\nb) Jobs within a job array will by definition all be using the same -o option, so the user should certainly include %I if using a job array.\nE.g. bsub -o mylogfile.%J.%I.o\nc) both a) and b) apply when using -e\nd) see job submission examples in https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/113-submit-jobs\nBut please also be aware of this issue WHEREVER you are writing to output files on JASMIN, whether using LOTUS or one of the SCI machines, and whether or not your storage is on one of the affected volumes (many users belong to multiple Group Workspaces).\nThanks in advance for your cooperation\nJASMIN Team"

        content: "The CEDA Archive has been a conduit for the research community to access a range of weather data supplied by the Met Office under the NERC-Met Office agreement for many years.\nUntil today, users wishing to use these data had to submit repeat applications for access to each of the dataset collections they wanted to use (e.g. three applications were needed to access radiosonde data, wind profiler data and surface observations). However, thanks to the agreement of the Met Office, we have been able to simplify this process with a new combined access route for users of Met Office weather data. This means users will now only have to apply once to access these data. You can apply for this new access here: https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/resreg/application?attributeid=ukmo_wx\nWhich data are included and which are not \u0026nbsp; The new combined access route has been applied to weather related datasets in the CEDA Archive including:\nSurface observations in the full MIDAS dataset collection Ceilometer data from the LIDARNET dataset collection Historic wind profiler and radiosonde data High resolution radiosonde data Model output from the operational Unified Model Met Research Flight (MRF) data You can see a full list of the dataset collections (with links to their catalogue entries) covered by this new access route at the bottom of our help article about this change, here.\nDataset from the Met Office Hadley Centre or those already available under the Open Government Licence are not covered by this new combined access route.\nFor new users \u0026nbsp; If you are a new user you simply need to find one of the datasets (see list) within the access group and apply for one of the datasets. Once granted you will then be able to access all the other datasets part of this new combined access route.\nFor existing users \u0026nbsp; Existing users of datasets now covered by the new access route will need to apply for access to this new combined access\ngroup by the end of August 2021. We’ll be emailing these uses during August to help them through this process.\nParallel access will be in place for existing access until the end of August 2021. After this, the existing access groups will be removed in order to allow CEDA to complete the transition to the new access arrangements. We hope that the length of the transition period will allow users to transition smoothly and benefit from the increased access they then achieve. Beyond greater access to more Met Office data, existing users should not notice any other changes.\nFor governmental users \u0026nbsp; The Met Office also permits access to these data for governmental use (e.g. by use within government departments or sponsored projects) through a dedicated option as part of the application process. Existing users with such access will also need to re-apply for access.\nNew Project Use? \u0026nbsp; As with the previous arrangements, access via this new route is only granted for the purpose included in the application. Where the use needs to change this requires a fresh application to be submitted which can be done at any time using the ‘request access’ link on any of the datasets covered by this new access application route.\nFor JASMIN users \u0026nbsp; No additional actions are needed with regards to JASMIN user accounts - the change in the access is managed through your CEDA Archive account.\nIf you don’t already have access to Met Office data then you may need to link your CEDA Archive account to your JASMIN User account - see here for instructions - and then follow the steps above for a ‘new user’. If you do already have access, then you will need to follow the steps under ‘existing users’ above.\nWe hope that this new access route will help our users to have easier access to Met Office data to aid their research. If you have any issues or comments please contact the CEDA helpdesk."

For JASMIN accounts, a verification code will be needed alongside a username and password when signing in to the JASMIN Accounts Portal. This helps prevent your account from being compromised even if an attacker steals your password. These verification codes are short-lived, single-use, 6-digit numbers that are sent to your registered email address when requested during the sign-in process.\nWhen will this be rolled out? \u0026nbsp; Two-step verification will be introduced using a phased approach. Initially, it will be required only for users with access to particular sensitive JASMIN services before being rolled out to all users by the end of spring 2020.\nWhat do I need to do? \u0026nbsp; This will require no action on your part other than using a verification code to log in to the JASMIN Accounts portal. This small, intuitive change to the signing in process will allow us to greatly improve security for JASMIN services. Note that SSH access to JASMIN will not be affected by this change. Thanks for your cooperation,\nJASMIN Support Team"

The EO Data Hub (EODH), via the University of Leicester, is using Delta eSourcing to run this tender exercise: https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?accessCode=6Q8HN2F35G\nThe estimated total value in this ITT is £1.15 million including VAT.\nOutline of the ITT \u0026nbsp; This ITT will bring successful data providers into the EODH programme as partners. They will provide:\nlinkage to existing commercial data streams through proven capabilities, EODH software interfaces (adaptors) and automated access to archived data, close working around data access improvements which can stimulate uptake including licensing , and access to large, existing datasets of value for demonstration and pre-operational research and development. We also seek support for resilient access to public data streams access for the EODH and improvements in global/temporal coverage.\nThe ideal applicants will further demonstrate in their bid, the capabilities for tasking, the development path for improved integrated search, registration and download facilities, and capacities for new data streams. This ITT is focussed on obtaining access to high resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets.\nThe total budget for the ITT, shared across up to two providers, is between £0.85 million and £1.15 million including VAT.\nAbout the EO Data Hub: \u0026nbsp; The EO DataHub\u0026nbsp; is a pathfinder service designed to offer UK users a step-change in Earth Observation data access and quality, serving commercial users, government, researchers and students. The overall goal of the project is to develop and operate a new centralised software infrastructure – DataHub – to provide a new ‘single point’ of access for UK EO data offerings from distributed public and commercial centres.\nThe EODH project team provide oversight and management of a consortium of experts from across research and the commercial sector.\nThe project brings together a strong team of partners from across the public sector and industry, that currently include:\nNational Centre for Earth Observation\u0026nbsp; (Lead Organisation), specifically the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) and the University of Leicester National Physical Laboratory\u0026nbsp; Met Office\u0026nbsp; Satellite Applications Catapult\u0026nbsp; UK Space Agency\u0026nbsp; Telespazio UK\u0026nbsp; The EODH is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council as part of the Earth Observation Investment Package of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology."

The issues are being investigated with cooperation from the platform vendor. As far as we are aware, the virtual machines themselves are running normally and are still accessible via SSH. If you are a cloud tenancy admin and are aware of any further problems, please report these to the JASMIN Helpdesk.\n2) System Maintenance planned for 5th October 2021.\nScheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 5th October 2021, which will cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services. Systems will be “at risk” and may be unavailable for all or part of the day.\nOn a regular (roughly quarterly) basis, important updates are applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure (which also hosts the CEDA Archive and associated services) in order to keep them up to date and secure. Servers may need to be rebooted in order for these changes to take effect, so there may be an interruption to JASMIN and CEDA services on this date. Other system work may also be scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption.\nThe LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 06:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.\nPlease look out for further announcements nearer the date, and apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused."

The power is now back, but not all remaining actions can be carried out remotely. We are awaiting confirmation for when a member of the JASMIN team is allowed to enter the machine room. With the covid-19 restrictions in place, this will take longer than normal. At present, we do not know how long it will take for us to be able to gain access. Therefore, unfortunately, we cannot give you an estimate of when the services will be back up and running - it is looking unlikely that it will be today. Update 2 - 22/06/2020 18:00 \u0026nbsp; Some limited services are back online but please consider all services AT RISK until further notice. Update 3 - 23/06/2020 10:30 \u0026nbsp; Some services are back online but many are still affected by yesterday\u0026rsquo;s power outage. Work is ongoing to restore these as quickly as possible. Please consider all services (CEDA Archive and JASMIN) at risk until further notice. Access to the JASMIN machine room is still necessary for some issues, as mentioned yesterday this will take longer than in normal circumstances (due to covid-19 restrictions). Unfortunately, we are unable to give an accurate timescale of when this can happen. Update 4 - 23/06/2020 17:00 \u0026nbsp; Some Much of JASMIN is now up, but for some significant components, work is still in progress.

If you believe anything isn’t working correctly, please let us know by contacting the appropriate helpdesk.\nA few of you have asked why JASMIN doesn’t have some form of back up, so we thought it might be useful to share the reason with you all. JASMIN has a power demand of around 200kW from ~50 full racks of equipment, network and tape robot infrastructure. It shares its machine room environment and some of these systems with facilities of similar scale for other communities and hence a power backup of suitable capacity and complexity would be prohibitively expensive for the science (rather than enterprise) budgets we’re working within. Many subsystems within JASMIN already run on UPS systems to provide short-term supply enabling clean shutdown, but continued operation without mains power is not something which is currently feasible.\nFuture updates: \u0026nbsp; We will update the status of the situation as it progresses via Twitter, our news channel and the JASMIN mailing lists. Please check here for further updates. We will keep monitoring the situation and will send another update soon.\nJASMIN Team"

The risk of disruption is small but if it occurs would result in all JASMIN and CEDA services being offline for several days if power was lost.\nDuring this period, work is being undertaken on the STFC RAL site (JASMIN’s host institution) as part of the construction of the new Rosalind Franklin Institute. Electrical work aims to connect this new facility to the site high-voltage supply which also supplies JASMIN. There is a small risk of loss of power to the JASMIN data centre while this work is undertaken. Loss of power would disrupt all CEDA and JASMIN services, and other STFC network services, which support remote working for STFC and JASMIN support staff, for many days if it happened.\nTo mitigate impact, STFC Estates, in association with the electrical contractor, SSE, will provide suitable generator capacity on 10th June to cover the period on 11th June for which the main feed will be down.\nRecovery from a power interruption would take several days, especially because of the implications of social distancing protocols currently required.\nWith apologies for any inconvenience caused,\nJASMIN Team"

This presents us with an opportunity to make decisions on the direction which we want to take the JASMIN Cloud. The timescale for this is by mid 2025.\nWe would like to ask all JASMIN Users to take the following short survey about the JASMIN Cloud so that we can gather information about why you do or do not use the cloud and about any features which you would like to see. Also we would specifically like to hear what existing tenants are using the cloud for so that we can capture those requirements.\nPlease click here to find the survey link.\u0026nbsp; Deprecation of CentOS 7 cloud images \u0026nbsp; As you may be aware, CentOS 7 is coming to its end of life in June. We have decided to move to Rocky Linux 9 for JASMIN services and are working hard to switch all JASMIN services to this as soon as possible.\nThe Rocky Linux 9 image has been available in the External cloud (*-U tenancies) for a few months. On 12th February the CentOS 7 image will be removed from all external tenancies meaning that no new machines will be able to be created with that image. We encourage you to migrate your machines over to Rocky Linux 9 (or Ubuntu) as soon as you can.\nWe will start chasing tenants in March to migrate their CentOS machines so that there are no remaining CentOS machines in the External cloud when CentOS 7 reaches its end of life.\nWe are still working on an image for the managed tenancies (*-M and *-S tenancies), and will be in touch with tenants in due course to migrate their machines over to Rocky Linux 9.\nUpcoming migration of the Cloud Portal to Azimuth \u0026nbsp; We will soon be changing the JASMIN Cloud portal to StackHPC’s Azimuth portal. For tenants who use the Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS) system, you will need to recreate your clusters in the new system that Azimuth provides when Azimuth is ready for use. We will provide generous overlap between the two systems to ease the transition as much as possible, but the current CaaS system will be turned off at the end of this period.\nAzimuth will also allow all existing external cloud tenants to use the platforms feature (the replacement for CaaS), not just tenancies with CaaS enabled. Hopefully this will provide more flexibility to tenants, especially with Azimuth’s greatly expanded platforms compared to the existing CaaS system.\nIf there are any questions about any of these topics, please feel free to email the JASMIN Helpdesk.

        description: "Forum addressing challenges of large scale data analysis in the atmospheric science community.",
        
        
        content: "Introduction On 25 September 2012, NCAS hosted a research forum at Reading University to address the challenges of large scale data analysis in the numerical weather prediction, oceanographic and climate science community. The forum heard presentations about many NCAS activities including UPSCALE, CASCADE, HiGEM and WISER as well as presentations from the EO, atmospheric composition and oceanographic perspectives.\nThe particular context was the recent purchase of the JASMIN and CEMS facilities which are managed by the Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. JASMIN and CEMS are designed to enable centralised terabyte to petabyte scale data analysis for the NCAS and NCEO communities. The forum also took a wider view of data analysis challenges faced by the community. In discussing these challenges and potential solutions the forum aimed to uncover common problems, how recent improvements in technology can address these problems and identify additional work needed - particularly in the area of parallel data analysis.\nThe forum started by introducing the JASMIN architecture and plans for meeting the data analysis needs of NCAS researchers. We then heard presentations from many projects and communities tackling large scale data analysis challenges, starting with those who have had early experience with the JASMIN system. We finished off with presentations on developments in analysis tools and visualisation and a general discussion.\nProgramme Topic Presenter PDF if available JASMIN infrastructure and Plans Ag Stephens Experience of JASMIN Early Adopters Technical aspects of the UPSCALE PROJECT a large simulation campaign Matthew Mizielinski Initial experiences with CEMS: EO data processing Ben Taylor Analysis Challenges from Atmospheric Science, Oceanography and Earth Observation Experiences of the CASCADE project S. Woolnough HiGEM/UJCC datasets, High-Resolution Climate Modelling L. Shaffrey Oceanography P. Challenor Big data challenges for atmospheric composition research Matt Evans A Weather climate change impact study at extreme resolution A. Gadian Processing EO data and its analysis with respect to models J. Remedios Analysis Tools: visualisation and parallelism Interactive visual analysis applications on JASMIN and CEMS J. Blower High-level tools for parallel analysis within JASMIN S. Pascoe JASMIN Community Intercomparrison Suite P. Stier Highlights The age of \"Big Data\" is generally recognised as bringing challenges of scale in 3 areas: volume, rate and complexity. The forum heard many examples of projects facing challenges in all three of these areas. All projects are experiencing data volume growth which has implications for the ability for individual institutions to meet their storage requirements. With increases in volume comes increases in transfer rates both from the site of production (e.g. an HPC facility or satellites) to where it is stored and from storage to the analysis platform. Even for moderate volumes of data, data complexity can overwhelm the ability of users to analyse the data with the tools at their disposal. Amongst the wide variety of topics discussed a few highlights are described below.\nM Mizielinski reported on the UPSCALE project as an example of an early adopter of the JASMIN system. UPSCALE expects ~300TiB (330TB) of data through the lifetime of the project with 1-2TiB generated per day. At this rate, transfer out of the HPC facility becomes a significant issue. The network links and data transfer services put in place by CEDA from HERMIT to JASMIN has managed up to 5-6TiB/day transfer to JASMIN where further analysis has been possible through direct access to the data from UPSCALE's dedicated analysis VMs.\nJ. Remedios, representing the EO community reported that after several years of being able to cope with the storage requirements of satellite products they were once again struggling to cope with the next generation of products. Next generation instruments such as the IRS on MTG-Sounder will produce 700 Tb/year from 2018 onwards. There is an increasing need for re-processing of EO data for climate applications and for the generation of multiple products from the same dataset. Synergies between different re-processing systems mean that the co-hosting of multiple datasets with analysis facilities is an obvious next step which they forsee will be met by CEMS.\nL. Shaffrey reported on the HiGEM project's experiences producing 60+TB of climate model output. Decadal forecasts expected to total 75+TB of NetCDF data. Storing HiGEM/UJCC datasets at BADC has been very successful. It allowed easy access for different institutions and removed the hassle of dataset access and archiving from scientists. Problems with the timely transfer of data from supercomputers to BADC were resolved quickly by BADC. The conversion of data from the UK Met. Office PP format to NetCDF was less successful, hampered by insufficient metadata. HiGEM found that the data volumes contemporary climate models cause serious problems for the tools generally available to users.\nMatt Evans described the data challenges faced by atmospheric composition research as both similar and distinct from the modelling and EO communities. Composition modelling also faces rapidly expanding data volumes but data complexity is a more significant challenge for them. Data in this field takes both numerical and symbolic forms, for instance the Leeds Master Chemical Mechanism, and their combination presents unique challenges for tool development.\nIn the tools section, J. Blower presented on the possibilities for visualisation through facilities like JASMIN and CEMS, emphasising the importance of visualisation for quality control, data discovery and data collaboration. P. Stier presented the upcoming JASMIN-CIS project to develop a high-level toolbox for intercomparison of EO, model and observation datasets which will be deployed on JASMIN. From CEDA S. Pascoe presented some forward-looking ideas for building parallelism into data analysis work-flows and how this might be achieved on JASMIN.\nConclusions It was clear from the discussion following the presentations that there is huge demand for centralised data storage and analysis facilities to meet the future needs of research. The JASMIN and CEMS facilities are already meeting this challenge but a lot of work remains to be done to capitalise on their initial success and develop them into mature infrastructure for earth system research. The forum's discussions also touched on wider challenges that the community faces in the age of data-driven research such as data format conversion, metadata generation and training of researchers in informatics. Sharing facilities, tools and expertise can make an important contribution to the search for solutions to these challenges."

        content: "Many of us have been to the coast and seen seabirds, but have you ever considered how they might be affected by climate change? The UK is surrounded by important populations of seabirds, including Arctic Tern, Kittiwake, and Puffin, that play a key role as top predators and indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Like many animals, seabirds are exposed to climate change in both marine and terrestrial environments, but the combined effects are rarely considered. Climate change impacts seabird species through a number of mechanisms; for example, by shifting the distributions of prey species, influencing storminess which affects mortality rates, causing overheating at the nest site, or increasing sea level and reducing available breeding habitat. CEDA services were used by researchers at the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) to predict future seabird abundance under both marine and terrestrial climate change, as part of the Marine Protected Area Management and Monitoring (MarPAMM) project.\nImage showing a puffin on a cliff. Credit: Jonathan Pie on Unsplash Image showing: A puffin standing on a cliff. Credit: Jonatan Pie on Unsplash\nBTO researchers analysed the relationship between important marine and terrestrial climate variables (such as sea surface temperature, ocean stratification, precipitation and temperature) and breeding abundance for 19 seabird species. It is important to understand the role of climate variables, such as those that measure how stratified the ocean is, because they can affect the prey species that make up the seabirds’ food supply. The project used UKCP18 data from the CEDA Archive and oceanographic data from Marine Scotland Science, which provided future climate projections for land and marine regions as well as observed (past) climate data for the UK. The researchers used JASMIN’s LOTUS cluster to parallelise running Bayesian spatial models to reveal the relationship between seabird abundance and various climate variables. Being able to parallelise the work on JASMIN meant that instead of taking ~380 hours (20 model runs * 19 species * ~1hr) to run the models consecutively on a personal machine, the work was completed in just a couple of hours. This greatly sped up a key part of the analysis.\nLead analyst on this research, Dr Jacob Davies, commented: “The ability to access data in the CEDA Archive and parallelise tasks on JASMIN enabled us to get through our analytical workflow much more rapidly than would otherwise have been possible, freeing up machines for other important BTO work. The responsiveness of the JASMIN Helpdesk made getting set up on JASMIN straightforward.”\nThe combination of using data held in the CEDA Archive and the analysis power of JASMIN, meant that the research could predict how seabirds may be affected by climate change. Predictions showed a decline in the majority of UK breeding seabirds by 2050 (based on the estimated relationships with climate). Uncertainty in the models was high, but for all but five species (Shag, Common Gull, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Black-headed Gull and Common Tern) the median predicted change showed a decline.\nThese predictions have been used to inform a climate change vulnerability assessment for the species concerned. The results will be published in a scientific paper later in the year. The team will continue to use JASMIN for future parallelisation work as it saved them much valuable time. Image showing a juvenile Herring Gull in Weymouth Harbour.

        content: "Over 600 different species of birds have been recorded in the UK to date[1] . For many of them formal monitoring is limited or absent. British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) ask for volunteers from the public to report nature observations from around the UK on mobile apps or online data entries such as BirdTrack. This is important because estimating bird distributions and population trends increases our knowledge about bird species or their habitats. Over 60,000 volunteers are involved recording bird species, resulting in a massive amount of data collected - in 2020 alone over 7.5 million records have been submitted to BirdTrack. Researchers at BTO have been using JASMIN to carry out statistical analysis on these data in order to better understand the reliability of Citizen Science data and the changes in UK bird populations that can be inferred from it.\nDr Philipp Boersch-Supan, the main researcher on this project, used the shared group workspaces on JASMIN to model the large complex bird population datasets from BirdTrack - with the particular aim of developing our understanding for less common British bird species, such as corn buntings or pied flycatchers. The project used LOTUS – JASMIN’s batch computing cluster - which splits the analyses into chunks so they can be run in parallel, thus speeding up the process. Using LOTUS means that the bird population models could be run for many different species in only a few hours, rather than weeks on a regular desktop computer. Corn Bunting - credit: Philipp Boersch-Supan / BTO Image - Corn Bunting (credit: Philipp Boersch-Supan / BTO)\nJASMIN enabled the project to process BirdTrack data by developing, testing and implementing statistical models for studying bird population trends. Dr Boersch-Supan explains “This research heavily relied on the computing and storage capabilities of JASMIN - which enabled us to do new types of analyses that had previously been impossible to conduct on our in-house hardware. We also relied on the ability to easily access climate data from the CEDA Archive to feed into our analyses”. The climate data included variables such as precipitation and temperature from the Met Office’s HadUK collection of gridded climate observations. JASMIN opens up the possibility of new types of analyses, resulting in a greater understanding of the UK’s bird populations with respect to environmental drivers such as climate. This research combined the use of JASMIN, bird populations (from BirdTrack) and climate data for the first time, resulting in a greater understanding of UK bird species population changes. Studying these trends can help us to gain a better understanding of how and why bird populations change by considering human and environmental drivers. These population trends are used in the annual UK Biodiversity Indicators report, compiled by the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp; Rural Affairs, which then feeds into the UK governments decision-making for environmental issues. This research aims to expand the number of rare bird species reported to the Biodiversity Indicators report, and therefore help inform conservation efforts for these rare species. Without JASMIN, this research would not have been possible. Contact:\nFor more information about using JASMIN, please contact our helpdesk: support@ceda.ac.uk To participate in BirdTrack and log your own observations visit www.birdtrack.net.

The current upgrade will ensure a better understanding of, and a quicker response to, environmental change.\nRun by STFC on behalf of NERC, JASMIN is based at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. It is half super-computer and half data-centre and as such provides a globally unique computational environment. It is responsible for two main functions: infrastructure for the data storage and services of the Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA), including the British Atmospheric Data Centre; and providing a platform for data-intensive scientific computation for the environmental science community.\nEnvironmental science is benefiting from an exponential increase in data from new observing platforms \u0026ndash; from sensor webs to Earth observation satellites. At the same time, increased computer power coupled with sophisticated mathematics, is opening up more environmental science to accurate simulation, which also generates vast quantities of data.\nAs a consequence, all environmental scientists face new infrastructural challenges. Recognising these challenges, STFC and NERC continue to invest in JASMIN \u0026ndash; a massive world class facility to provide UK environmental science with a unique platform for data analysis.\nMany datasets, particularly model data, are too big to be easily shipped around. JASMIN enables scientists to bring their processing to the data.\nLaunch event presentations Ned Garnett Acting Director of Research, NERC Stephen Mobbs Director, National Centre for Atmospheric Science Bryan Lawrence Professor of Weather and Climate Computing, University of Reading \u0026amp; Director, Centre for Environmental Data Archival Matthew Mizielinski Met Office Hadley Centre Peter-Jan van Leeuwen Interim Director, National Centre for Earth Observation Andrew Taylor Director, National Laboratories, STFC \"STFC is pleased to exploit our expertise in data management and scientific computing to support NERC by delivering this key national facility, which we expect to underpin analysis of large environmental datasets for many years to come.\"\nDr Andrew Taylor, STFC Director of National Laboratories\n\"NERC welcomes this major upgrade to this world-class facility. JASMIN is a unique hybrid of petascale storage, high-performance computing and networking, coupled with cloud hosting capabilities, and will make a significant contribution to one of NERC's most strategically important challenges: the improvement of predictive environmental science.\"\nProfessor Duncan Wingham, NERC Chief Executive\n\"With this upgrade, JASMIN will provide the entire NERC community with a key platform to exploit the heterogeneous and high volume data typical of modern environmental science.\"\nProfessor Stephen Mobbs, Director of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)\n\"With JASMIN, the UK will be well placed to exploit the wealth of earth observation data coming from the European Space Agency and elsewhere over the next decade.\"\nProfessor Peter Jan van Leeuwen, Acting Director of the National Centre for Earth Observation"

        content: "Scheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 21st AND 28th April 2020, some of which will result in disruption to JASMIN systems, services and data in addition to the CEDA Archive.\nThe following work is currently scheduled for these dates:\n21st April : disruption due to network maintenance and quarterly patch updates\nThere will be a small network change which will interrupt storage visibility for ALL virtual machines (and any JASMIN or CEDA services running on them) for at least part of the day. This is part of a long programme of work to improve storage access and reliability during 2020. Once that change is stable, the usual quarterly patch updates will proceed, including rebooting of servers where necessary for the changes to take effect. 28th April : “At risk”\nOn this date the Quobyte storage servers will have their network card firmware and driver software updated. This can be done one server at a time and so should be transparent to users. However there is some risk of disruption so please be aware. The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on 21st April to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. The reservation will start at 06:00 on 21st April, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.\nWith apologies for any inconvenience caused,\nJASMIN Team"

Additionally, we will replace the existing batch scheduler (Platform LSF) with SLURM. We have chosen SLURM because it is a cost-effective alternative which is widely used by other academic/scientific institutions (such as the UK Met Office).\nThese changes will affect nearly all JASMIN users so please take note!\nThe first scheduled changes are as follows:\nTwo new “sci” servers, “sci[1,2].jasmin.ac.uk/”, will be created with the CentOS7 systems and the new software environments. These two VMs will be available and listed under the Message Of The Day on jasmin-login1, from mid-February. [Please note that the domain name of the servers has changed from “.ceda.ac.uk/” to “jasmin.ac.uk/”]. The “centos7\u0026quot; queue (currently used for testing) will be closed. A sub-cluster managed by SLURM will be deployed on Centos7 nodes. We will update JASMIN users with details and timeline soon. The transition period from LSF to SLURM is provisionally 6 months (February-31st July). During this period users are encouraged to migrate their workflows to the Centos7 queues which will be managed by SLURM. Migration of the transfer, login and other general-purpose servers will be communicated in future announcements.\nPrevious announcements on this topic are detailed here: http://www.jasmin.ac.uk/articles/vm-migration/\nThank you for your attention and please look out for further updates as this work progresses.\nCEDA and JASMIN Team"

Among other updates, this should address current issues with the PFS disk space usage reporting utility pan_df.\nNew scratch area and retiring /work/scratch/pw\nA new 1 PB scratch volume will be made available at /work/scratch-pw3, which will replace the old volume /work/scratch-pw: /work/scratch/pw will be made Read Only from 22nd November with no further access from 15th December Available scratch volumes from then on will be /work/scratch/pw2 /work/scratch/pw3, both 1 PB in size Any important data on /work/scratch/pw should be removed from that location before the 15th December 2022 Slurm configuration update As part of the continuous improvement to the Slurm scheduler, new features will be enabled on the scheduler to manage the load and control resources allocation for accessing the queues. The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 05:00 am on 22nd November till 02:00 pm****on the day, but any job submitted before 05:00 am with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.\nIMPORTANT: No jobs will be accepted by SLURM from 05:00 am on 22nd November****until the reservation is lifted. Any attempt to submit a job to SLURM will be rejected with the following message: sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Required partition not available (inactive or drain)\nJASMIN accounts portal upgrade A downtime is required to upgrade the JASMIN Accounts Portal service, the application where users can administer their own JASMIN accounts.\nWhilst this downtime ought to be brief, access to https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/ is considered at risk throughout the morning. The upgrade should provide performance improvements and reduce the need for downtimes for this service in future.\nLOTUS at risk periods monthly schedule Going forward, we will be performing routine updates to the cluster LOTUS on a monthly basis. These are planned for the second Tuesday of each month (8:00am-10:30am). Emergency/major updates may interrupt this schedule – notice will be provided - but this new, regular maintenance window should help users to plan their work around these incremental interventions while minimising disruption.\nGlobus Connect Personal users: important update required Users who have installed instance(s) of Globus Connect Personal (software provided by Globus to run a local endpoint for data transfers) should already be aware via communications from Globus that an update is required in order to continue using the Globus service. Please see this announcement and note the deadline of 12th December 2022.\nPlease note all the above updates and plan your work accordingly to minimise any inconvenience caused.\nThank you for your attention.\nBest wishes,\nJASMIN team"

Note that these updates are also available on the website news section: https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/\nContents:\nReminder: scheduled maintenance Tuesday 6th July New disk storage capacity: coming soon Update on Elastic Tape service Update on data transfer issue 1) Reminder: Scheduled maintenance Tuesday 6th July 2021\nScheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 6th July 2021, which will cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services. Systems will be “at risk” and users should expect many essential services (including compute and storage) to be unavailable for all or part of the day. Please plan your work to avoid using JASMIN on this day.\nOn a regular (roughly quarterly) basis, important updates are applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure (which also hosts the CEDA Archive and associated services) in order to keep them up to date and secure. Servers may need to be rebooted in order for these changes to take effect, so there may be an interruption to JASMIN and CEDA services on this date. Other system work is also scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption.\nThe LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 06:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.\n2) New disk storage capacity: coming soon\nMuch of the new disk storage purchased at the end of last year has now been delivered and the Scientific Computing Department team has been working hard with the relevant vendors to get this new hardware installed, tested and made operational. This has taken longer than planned for various reasons, but we now anticipate the first new storage coming online in July. Further updates about other benefits brought by the Phase 7 upgrade will follow in due course.\n3) Update on Elastic Tape Service\nSince earlier this year, the Elastic Tape service has been out of action to most users, for reasons mentioned in our previous update. Extensive testing and reconfiguration of relevant systems has enabled us to invite selected users to test the system with us over the past few weeks, which has been successful.\nMeanwhile, essential updates to the system to work with an updated operating system are also being applied, requiring further testing, which has also now completed successfully. We are taking this opportunity to apply this update before the return to service to avoid the need for further interruptions in the near future. If all goes as planned, we anticipate that the Elastic Tape service (including command line clients and use via JDMA) should be generally available again from Wednesday 7th July 2021, the day after the planned maintenance mentioned above. Please look out for further announcements and accept our sincere apologies for the unavailability of this service for what we appreciate has been a significant time.\n4) Update on data transfer issue\nAn issue has been affecting some data transfer methods (for example Globus Online) for several months. The JASMIN team is still investigating the cause and how to address it, but our current advice is summarised in this article.\nWe apologise for any inconvenience caused by these issues.\nJASMIN Team"

It is caused by a problem with the software used to access the storage from the machine where you may be working. A fix for this issue will be released in the next version of the software when available from the vendor and applied across the platform at the earliest opportunity. Short-term solution: For now, the recommended workaround for users is to move to a different machine if possible. Issue 2: This appears as file systems appearing to hang/freeze and becoming unavailable. The vendor is currently investigating and actively trying to fix this issue, but has not yet identified a solution. Short-term solution: A workaround for now would be to try accessing the same filesystem from a different machine (where it should still be mounted) or try again later from the same machine. Please also be aware that as of 14:30 today, the RAL site is still experiencing some network connectivity issues following yesterday’s RAL firewall changes. We await further information but we are told that if the situation has not stabilised by the end of today it is possible that yesterday’s changes may be rolled back.

While the shutdown of CEDA’s host organisation, STFC, runs from 15:00 on Friday 22nd December 2022 to 09:00 on Tuesday 2nd January 2024, a reduced number of staff remain at work from Friday 15th December, so we are unable to offer a normal helpdesk service between those dates.\nCEDA and JASMIN services should therefore be considered to be running “at-risk” from 17:00 on Friday 15th December to 9:00 on Tuesday 2nd January 2024, with little or no helpdesk service available during this period. A “change freeze” is also in place as of 17:00 on Thursday 14th December, so requests for new or changes to existing services will not be dealt with until the New Year.\nCEDA websites, archives and services, including access to JASMIN, should be available during this period but will operate unsupported. Should any problems occur to our services, it is unlikely that these would be fixed until staff return in the New Year.\nEmergency cover for site services (for issues such as fire or power outage) remains in place during the site shutdown period. Although we anticipate that the JASMIN infrastructure will remain operational throughout, it is possible that some issues may not receive attention until staff return in the New Year.\nAll user queries received during this period will be answered as soon as possible from Tuesday 2nd January 2024.\nClosure period schedule: \u0026nbsp; Thursday 14th December 2023 - 17:00 \u0026nbsp; change freeze starts limited helpdesk support available Friday 22nd December 2023 \u0026nbsp; site closure at 15:00 GMT services unsupported. Tuesday 2nd January 2024 \u0026nbsp; site reopens normal service resumes The CEDA and JASMIN teams would like to take this opportunity to wish all our users a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\nLOTUS throughput/capacity will be reduced while the network switch work is carried out. \u0026nbsp; By a gradual rack-draining, compute nodes per rack will be in “maint” state when viewed in SLURM node information e.g. sinfo\nScheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 16th January - 2024 \u0026nbsp; This will cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services. Systems will be “at risk” and may be unavailable for all or part of the day. Other system work is also scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption. The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 05:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.\nNew community discussion forum: \u0026nbsp; If you have useful tips or topics for discussion, feel free to contribute to the discussions taking shape over at our new \u0026ldquo;jasmin-community\u0026rdquo; area here: (you\u0026rsquo;ll need a Github account to post) https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-community/discussions\nFor support enquiries, please continue to contact the helpdesk at support@jasmin.ac.uk\nThank you for your attention and please look out for further updates as this work progresses.\nJASMIN Team"

The hackathon made use of the JASMIN notebook service, group workspace storage and processing simulations on the LOTUS batch processing cluster. \u0026nbsp; The EERIE project\u0026nbsp; is developing improved Earth system models, harnessing Europe’s pre-exascale computers and considering European ocean mesoscale eddies in preparation for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The project’s first General Assembly, held in Germany, saw 43 project members from 15 different project partners attend an extra two days for the project’s first hackathon. The aim of the hackathon was for participants to get to know each other while looking at some of the initial EERIE high-resolution eddy-resolving simulations and to gain experience using some relevant software tools.\nSome of the data from the EERIE simulations were stored on JASMIN, other data were stored at DKRZ\u0026nbsp; in Germany. Using JASMIN and DKRZ’s Jupyter Notebook services, everyone at the hackathon had a similar interface to the data irrespective of which dataset they were using or where they were working. Everyone made great progress in just two days, learning many new skills and generating some promising initial results for the project. JASMIN staff were available to help provide any support needed and everyone was able to access and use JASMIN successfully during the event.\nIf you have an idea for a training event or hackathon that could benefit from access to JASMIN please get in touch.\u0026nbsp; We have the ability to provide JASMIN training accounts which can be “borrowed” for your own training event and configured for your needs. Further details can be found here.\u0026nbsp;"

Details:\nRegular scheduled maintenance day: 11 July 2023\nOn a (roughly quarterly) basis, important updates are applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure (which also hosts the CEDA Archive and associated services) in order to keep them up to date and secure. Servers may need to be rebooted in order for these changes to take effect, so there may be an interruption to JASMIN and CEDA services on this date.\nThe LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 05:00 AM on the day, and any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.\nAdditional NX server now available: nx-login4\nAn additional NX server has been added to the NoMachine graphical desktop service. This server, nx-login4.jasmin.ac.uk shares the same network configuration as the other servers nx-login[23] so is available from anywhere (no reverse DNS required), but has the additional feature that it should work for users with longer usernames (greater than 8 characters). If you have had problems previously with agent forwarding (i.e. making an onward connection to other machines with NX), then you should try this machine to see if that solves the problem for you. Some users with very long usernames (created before a rule was introduced to limit them!) may still experience issues: please contact the helpdesk if this is the case.\nSee https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4810-graphical-linux-desktop-access-using-nx\nReboot of gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk server planned for Tuesday 13th June 08:30\n(mainly for GWS managers who expose their GWS data via HTTP)\nThis server, which provides HTTP access to public data files in group workspaces, will need to be rebooted at Tuesday 13th June 08:30 which will cause a brief interruption to that service.\nNB. Within the next few months we are preparing to move this service over to a new technology, which will take over the service at the same URL in due course. If your GWS currently exposes data via the existing service at https://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk, please try out the alternative form of the service which is now (temporarily) available at the URL https://gws-access-xp.jasmin.ac.uk and let us know if anything does not work (note some absolute URLs may not work in this temporary form). Please also look out for further announcements about the future of this service.\nPlease plan your work accordingly to minimise any inconvenience caused.\nThank you for your attention.\nBest wishes,\nJASMIN Team"

        content: "JASMIN Unavailable Wednesday 14th March Changes to Group Workspace storage There will be a major upgrade of JASMIN over the next few months, more than doubling the available storage and adding significantly more compute. The upgrade will involve a rolling programme of data migration that will affect everyone.\nThe first installment of upgrades involves migration of home directories during which there will be no access to JASMIN. This will be followed by migration of data off storage that needs retirement - we will attempt to minimise the impact of the migration on users. JASMIN Home Directory migration Wednesday 14th March User home directories will be moved to new storage on this date. Users will not be able to log in to JASMIN and many services may be unavailable between 07:00 and 19:00. Access to JASMIN Unmanaged Cloud tenancies should not be affected. This intervention has been timed to coincide with scheduled maintenance on the RAL Site Firewall which will cause a break in connectivity between 07:00 and 07:30 on the same day. CEDA may also take the opportunity to undertake scheduled maintenance to internal services.\nChanges to JASMIN Group Workspace Storage All group workspaces with paths /group_workspaces/jasmin and /group_workspaces/cems (not jasmin2 or cems2) will be migrated to new storage over the coming weeks. The most important issue for users to recognise is that the paths to their GWS will change. During the change, there may be short interruptions to service on a “per-GWS” basis. Some of the new storage is using a new technology, and will not support shared file writes with MPI-IO - if you think this might be a problem for you, please contact the JASMIN support team via the CEDA Helpdesk (support@ceda.ac.uk). If you are a GWS manager, please find further details here as to how this will affect you and your users.\nWe thank you in advance for your cooperation with these changes while the next generation of JASMIN technology is brought into operation.\nJASMIN Team"

For Items 1 \u0026amp; 2, please refer to our earlier announcement of 23/02/2018 or visit http://www.jasmin.ac.uk/phase4 for details.\nREMINDER:\nMOST OF JASMIN WILL BE UNAVAILABLE 07:00 - 19:00 ON WEDNESDAY 14TH MARCH 2018 - Although this unavailability should not affect virtual machines running in the JASMIN Unmanaged Cloud, any data services which they rely on in the main JASMIN infrastructure should be regarded as unavailable or at least at high risk of interruption on that day.\nIn addition, please be aware of the following:\n3. On 14th March, /work/scratch (used as intermediate storage by LOTUS jobs, not for general interactive use) will be set up on new storage. The following steps will take place:\na) Existing \u0026ldquo;/work/scratch\u0026rdquo; will be renamed \u0026ldquo;/work-scratch-OLD\u0026rdquo; and made READ-ONLY.\nb) A new \u0026ldquo;/work/scratch\u0026rdquo; area will be created (same size) on newer storage. However, you should configure your software to use this ONLY if you think you need shared file writes with MPI-IO.\nc) A second, larger area, \u0026ldquo;/work/scratch-nompiio\u0026rdquo; will be created (estimated size 250TB) on new flash-based storage which should have significant performance benefits particularly for operations involving lots of small files.\nIn advance of (3), a reservation is already in place to drain LOTUS of jobs so that this work can take place as scheduled. From today (7th March), 7-day jobs will not be scheduled. From tomorrow, 6-day jobs will not, and so on. Normal LOTUS service should resume once the work has completed on 14th March.\nDuring the entire period from now until mid-April, there is the possibility of further unplanned interruptions to aspects of the infrastructure while installation work is carried out. No further planned downtimes are currently scheduled, but the nature of the work involved carries some risk that unscheduled incidents may occur.\nWe thank you in advance for your cooperation with these changes while the next generation of JASMIN technology is brought into operation and look forward to telling you more about them as the work progresses.\nJASMIN Team"

The open-source data used to confirm this finding was processed on JASMIN - the UK’s data analysis facility for environmental science. ‘It’s the first time we’ve ever recorded a volcanic plume reaching the mesosphere,’ said Dr Simon Proud, a National Centre for Earth Observation senior scientist at the University of Oxford and RAL Space. ‘Using JASMIN to process this data meant that I could store and share the very large datasets required. This meant my colleagues did not have to duplicate downloading the data.’ Dr Proud also made use of JASMIN’s batch compute cluster, called LOTUS, to parallelise the workflow, speeding up the time it took to get the results. ‘I created all of the graphics that were distributed to the media using JASMIN. It’s a huge benefit being able to access all the computing services I need in one place.’ said Dr Proud.\nYou can read more about Simon’s research here.\nYou can find out more about the JASMIN services used by looking at our documentation: Group workspaces LOTUS batch computing The three satellites used to capture and evaluate the eruption were GOES-17 (USA), Himawari-8 (Japan) and GeoKompSat-2A (Korea)."

If you make use of software on JASMIN (via JASPY and module env.), then this talk is for you!\u0026nbsp; Transition to SLURM JASMIN's\u0026nbsp;batch processing scheduler\u0026nbsp;has recently been changed - find out what\u0026nbsp;these changes mean for your workflow. This talk is suitable for anyone who wants to learn about using the batch scheduler service\u0026nbsp;for high throughput data processing on JASMIN.\nTenancy sci-machines We are moving towards a new way of providing sci-server support, based on \"community-specific\" machines. This talk will explain what that means - suitable for anyone who uses the sci-machines for analysis.\u0026nbsp; Notebook service We recently launched\u0026nbsp;a new service\u0026nbsp;that allows access to JASMIN using Jupyter Notebooks. If you want to learn about analysing and visualising data with Python inside a web-browser, then this talk is for you!\nCluster as a Service (CaaS) CaaS\u0026nbsp;is a\u0026nbsp;new\u0026nbsp;service on JASMIN\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp;Community\u0026nbsp;Cloud that\u0026nbsp;allows\u0026nbsp;groups to develop their own bespoke applications and services from a set of ready-made building blocks.\u0026nbsp; A point and click interface on the Cloud Portal enables users to for example provision their own private Jupyter notebook service - or more advanced use cases such as making your own batch computing cluster (independent of LOTUS), or having your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy container-based applications into.\u0026nbsp;\nThis service requires users to have at least some dev/systems experience in\u0026nbsp;their\u0026nbsp;team to get these custom services up and running - find out more in this talk! Object store A\u0026nbsp;new\u0026nbsp;type of storage\u0026nbsp;that is likely to become more commonly used on JASMIN. This talk will explain what it means for your workflow.\u0026nbsp; Metrics Have a sneak peek at our new metrics dashboard Q\u0026amp;A panel We will\u0026nbsp;address questions that have been submitted throughout the webinars during this session. We hope to\u0026nbsp;answer as many questions as possible - however, please note some questions may need to be answered 'offline' due to their technical/specialist focus.\u0026nbsp; Wrap up and close of JASMIN2020 virtual event"

The webinar aimed to introduce space agencies and environmental organisations worldwide to Jupyter Notebooks and take a tour of emerging services from CEOS agencies and their applications. We illustrated how they can be used to support capacity development and the exploitation of Earth Observation data by a broad range of users. There were two sessions via zoom to allow for global attendance.\u0026nbsp;\nAgenda What are Jupyter Notebooks, and why they have the potential to support capacity development?\nWe will provide an overview of what a Jupyter Notebook is and the benefits of using one. We will demonstrate using a simple example of plotting sea surface temperature data, navigating an archive and adjusting the colour scale. We continue by describing the ways it is supported by open-source resources and by different types of platform/environment. We then discuss how collaborative research and activities such as international Hackathons can also be supported.\nJupyter Hub and Notebooks on Data Analysis Platforms:\nWe take a look at two examples from the UK\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp;JASMIN\u0026nbsp;Jupyter notebook service, which can access over 20 Petabytes of data on the\u0026nbsp;CEDA archive. We take a look at the Sentinel 5p global archive of data and demonstrate how by using a very basic notebook, we can explore questions such as how did pollution levels change in large cities during the Pandemic. We then continue by looking at the smaller scale specialist example of regional\u0026nbsp;NCEO\u0026nbsp;biomass maps. We can demonstrate how in addition to obtaining domain-specific information from data, we can also train users on some technical aspects such as libraries, modules and shapefiles.\nOpen Data Cube and Google Earth Engine \u0026ndash; A Jupyter Notebook Sandbox Demonstration\nThe Open Data Cube (ODC) Google Sandbox is a free and open programming interface that connects users to Google Earth Engine datasets. The open-source tool allows users to run Python application algorithms using Google\u0026rsquo;s Colab notebook environment. This demonstration will look at two examples Landsat applications focused on scene-based cloud statistics and historic water extent. Basic operation of the tool will support unlimited users for small-scale analyses and training but can also be scaled in size and scope with Google Cloud resources to support enhanced user needs.\u0026nbsp;\nESA PGDS data cube and Times series Data\u0026nbsp;\nThe ESA PDGS Data Cube is a pixel-based access service that enables human and machine-to-machine interfaces for Heritage Missions (HM), Third-Party Missions (TPM) and Earth Explorer (EE) datasets. The pixel-based access service provides the users with advanced retrieval capabilities such as time series extraction, data subsetting, mosaicking, band combinations and indexes generation (e.g. NDVI, anomalies, \u0026hellip;) directly from the EO-SIP packages with no need of data duplication or data preparation.\nIn addition to the\u0026nbsp;Explorer\u0026nbsp;web-based graphic user interface, the ESA PDGS Data Cube service also provides the\u0026nbsp;Jupyter\u0026nbsp;processing environment to allow users to import, write and execute code that runs close to the data. This demonstration will showcase how to retrieve Soil Moisture time-series using the Jupyter environment in order to generate thematic maps (monthly anomalies map) over an area of interest. The benefit of using the pixel-based service with respect to traditional access services in term of resources usage will be also highlighted.\nEarth Analytics and Interoperability Lab \u0026ndash; Big Data Processing\nThe CEOS Earth Analytics Interoperability Lab (EAIL) is a platform for CEOS projects to test interoperability in a live EO ecosystem. EAIL is hosted on Amazon Web Services and includes facilities for Jupyter notebooks, scalable compute infrastructure for integrated analysis and data pipelines that can connect to new and existing CEOS data discovery and access services. This demonstration will show how we use Jupyter notebooks with the python Dask library to efficiently compute and perform large-scale analyses (10s GB) with interactive plotting and scalable compute resources in EAIL.\nCapacity Development Panel and Discussion\nKenton Ross from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Capacity Building and Applied Sciences Program will lead discussions with a panel of international experts. We will explore the needs of EO data users worldwide and how this can be supported by CEOS agencies.\u0026nbsp;\nWednesday 21st\u0026nbsp;July 14:00 \u0026ndash; 16:20 UTC Panelists: Edward Boamah (Digital Earth Africa), Sean McCartney (NASA DEVELOP) Thursday 22nd\u0026nbsp;July\u0026nbsp; 02:00 \u0026ndash; 04:20 UTC Panelists:\u0026nbsp;Edward Boamah (Digital Earth Africa), Franz Meyer (University of Alaska Fairbanks) Speakers:\u0026nbsp;Kenton Ross (NASA), Yousuke Ikehata (JAXA), Esther Conway (NCEO/UKSA), Brian Killough (SEO/NASA), Giuseppe Troina (ESA), Matt Paget (CSIRO)"

        content: "In the past month, and following the configuration changes to LOTUS over the summer, we have not been able to fully resolve issues around longer queue wait times, despite the mechanisms outlined here.\nWhile the changes we advertised then were successful in dealing with the known problems, there have been continuing reports of ongoing difficulties. We continue to work on these, but many of them are simply down to load: during this year the LOTUS load has grown so there are more big users and longer wait times. Disentangling problems which arise from load and those which arise from configuration has been, and continues to be, difficult. We now believe that we will have to make some rather major changes to the LOTUS environment. This update covers what we have done, what we plan to do in the near future, and outlines some of the necessary changes ahead. At the end of this sequence of changes we are aiming to improve response time (i.e. deliver shorter queue waits) for the bulk of users, while giving more predictability to the larger users. Unfortunately, giving more predictability will likely involve more workflow scheduling by those large users (less relying on the LOTUS batch scheduler) and an allocation mechanism to limit usage. Exactly how we achieve that is under discussion and will need to be ratified by the CEDA/JASMIN Board before deployment. However, there are many things we can do in the meanwhile to improve things for most users.\nWhat have we done? \u0026nbsp; As is obvious, we have completed the transition from the LSF to the SLURM scheduler. This was an unavoidable change; the good news is that the volume of work (in core hours) has been sustained throughout the transition, and in fact now exceeds that which was being done prior to the transition: The increase in workload was possible because more compute nodes have been added to LOTUS and distributed into the various queues. A new queue with dedicated compute nodes has been temporarily (see below) added for short serial jobs with a maximum run time limit of 4 hours - “short-serial-4hr”. We continue to modify the way that jobs are prioritised (the “fairshare” algorithm). Since the last announcement we have made changes to increase the priority of smaller jobs in all queues and to further decrease the priority of those who have recently used a lot of resources. Some additional community queues have been temporarily (see below) established to support some of the more time-orientated operational activities. What do we plan to do in the near future? \u0026nbsp; We are monitoring LOTUS usage (including wait times per queue) on a weekly basis, and will continue to tweak the fairshare algorithm over time. We will reconfigure the limits which apply to jobs to make it easier for the scheduler to do prioritisation. We will restructure the SLURM queues (“partitions”) to better separate workflows, and in doing so limit the number of jobs any one user can have scheduled at any one time in some queues, and ensure those queues have priority. In practice this means all the existing queues can be considered as “temporary” until such time as we announce and deploy the new queue structure. In the mid-term we expect to: \u0026nbsp; 1st Quarter 2021: Develop policy and mechanisms for dividing the workload between “large allocations” and “daily on-demand analysis”, with the former delivered via a fast, responsive, lightweight allocations procedure based on funding source and consortium-wide allocations. 2nd Quarter 2021: Add more hardware to the LOTUS queues. Future announcements will give details and warning of all the fundamental changes (i.e. which go beyond tweaking the fairshare algorithm).\nHow can you help us? \u0026nbsp; Those communities who have predictable large demands and the financial resources to buy into dedicated queues (with dedicated hardware) should discuss their requirements with the JASMIN team so we can give you reliable service without impacting the general users. We continue to value feedback, and in particular feedback which gives us enough information to understand your requirements and how the system response to those requirements has changed (particularly changes since October and in response to changes we might make after today). Recognise that as we make changes, it will sometimes take weeks to see how those changes have manifested for the average workload (since of course, on a week by week basis, nothing you do is average - in any sense).

        content: "Scientists will soon have access to triple the processing power for analysing environmental data. A £5.7 million investment for expanding the parallel compute cluster, called LOTUS\u0026nbsp; , on JASMIN has been secured. The improved infrastructure allows much greater volume of parallel computing tasks - where multiple streams of data analysis tasks are undertaken at the same time - whilst reducing the time that users have to wait for their analysis to complete. Capacity will be tripled and will be available to users from Summer 2024.\nJASMIN is a globally-unique data analysis facility\u0026nbsp; - part of UKRI’s digital research infrastructure\u0026nbsp; . It provides storage and compute facilities to enable data-intensive environmental science. Over 1500 users are currently supported exploring topics ranging from climate change and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation and analysis of wildlife populations. This investment is from the UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure funding stream, with the work commissioned by NERC and delivered by STFC as part of the on-going cross-council collaboration on JASMIN to serve the environmental science community.\nCentred more around storage and data analysis than a “traditional” supercomputer, JASMIN provides flexibility for a wide range of data-intensive analysis workflows. The renewal and expansion of the LOTUS parallel compute cluster will enable users to make use of ~55,000 compute cores - more than tripling the current capacity. This will provide better performance, reduce task queuing time, and improve the ability to meet the wide range of user requirements.\nProfessor David Stevens, University of East Anglia, Chair of NERC’s High Performance Computing Steering Committee said ‘JASMIN is a critical resource for UK environmental research – enabling ground-breaking research that otherwise would not be possible. This expansion, as a result of the ongoing NERC-STFC collaboration, will significantly enhance its capability for the community.’\nThis upgrade complements a range of other JASMIN services that enable environmental research, including but not limited to;\na GPU cluster for AI workflows\u0026nbsp; interactive analysis tools\u0026nbsp; such as a Notebook service direct access to the long-term CEDA archive\u0026nbsp; which hosts over 20PB of atmospheric and earth observation data Our mission, aligned with UKRI strategy, is to ensure our systems work in the most environmentally sustainable way. Sustainability formed a key criteria in the procurement process for this upgrade. There will be an improved performance per watt compared to the existing LOTUS hardware, but as capacity has increased, it is likely energy consumption will too.\nThe team are actively researching and implementing ways to improve sustainability e.g. reducing and removing hardware/data that is not being used, and implementing measures to operate the system in the most efficient way. Funding to look at practical next steps for net zero and sustainability has been secured - building upon the findings of the UKRI Net Zero Digital Research Infrastructure Scoping Project\u0026nbsp; . An example is to establish a better process for extracting carbon metrics for each individual user or science project.\nAdditional Information \u0026nbsp; JASMIN is operated and supported by a small but innovative team with expertise in systems administration, computer science, research software engineering and environmental informatics.\nJASMIN is designed, integrated and operated by the Science \u0026amp; Technology Facilities Council (STFC) on behalf of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)\u0026nbsp; . Architectured jointly between STFC’s Scientific Computing\u0026nbsp; and RAL Space\u0026nbsp; Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA).\nCEDA provides services, including JASMIN, on behalf of NERC via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)\u0026nbsp; and the National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO)\u0026nbsp; .\nContact \u0026nbsp; For more information, contact Poppy Townsend: support@ceda.ac.uk"

The changeover is scheduled for 28th October 2003. **Users of the data need to be aware of the following points:** - The data will be ordered from South to North, instead of North to South. - As before, the wind components (u and v) will be produced on a grid that is staggered relative to the mass grid (used for T and z). The output fields use the \u0026#34;Arakawa B grid\u0026#34; staggering, as before, even though the ND model uses a \u0026#34;C grid\u0026#34; staggering. - The vertical velocity will be w (dz/dt), rather than omega (dP/dt), and will be output on the mass grid. - Three additional UARS levels will be output (25 instead of 22), up to 0.1 hPa (instead of 0.316 hPa). If you use the grid definitions in the PP header record, the changes to the ordering of the data will be transparent, otherwise you will need modify your programs to allow for those changes. Access routines are supplied by the Met Office to help users read the data files. The original versions were written to access data from the UARS CDHF, but recent versions also read PP format data, as supplied to the BADC. A revised version of the access routines has been written (version 5c - file name acsasm_v5c.f). This is very similar to the previous version (5b), except that it will recognize the new w fields (as well as omega), and the default settings for field types and number of levels have been modified for New Dynamics. VAX/VMS-specific code (only a few lines) has been deleted. At the BADC, the new data files can be found in the current year assimilated data directory: /badc/ukmo-assim/data/standard/2003/ The associated documentation, as provided by the Met Office is available in the assimilated data doc directory: /badc/ukmo-assim/doc/ieee_binary/new_dynamics/ The Assimilated data documentation on the BADC Web pages will be updated shortly.

        content: "Hi! I’m Elle Smith and I’m a Software Engineer at the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA). The first time I started to code was in my first year of university, where I was studying physics. We had a whole module learning how to apply our programming skills to solve physics-based problems. I hated this module, I felt like I never really knew what was going on, but I stuck with it. As time went on and I practiced, I started to enjoy this work more and more, although I still never considered that software engineering would be something I would pursue.\nIt was only when I was starting applying for jobs that I thought about what I actually enjoy doing the most - and what I would continue to enjoy even when I was doing it every day! The answer I settled on was using code to solve real-life problems, which is how I ended up working at CEDA. My current role is a Software Engineer focusing on environmental data analysis, providing data and computing services to researchers working in the environmental sciences in the UK and the wider international community.\nOne of the projects that I’ve been working on is building a Web Processing Service (WPS) which provides access to global climate projections from the largest ever climate modelling project to date - the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). Large datasets like CMIP6 can be complex and often intimidating for users. Our tool allows users to subset large datasets spatially or temporally. This means that users can easily access and download only the data that they need, making working with it easier and more efficient. Access to this data in this way has been much anticipated, so it’s great knowing that work I have done is contributing to current climate science research. The future plans for the WPS are to provide averaging and regridding tools on top of subsetting, as well as making these tools available for data from other climate modelling experiments. These tools will allow users to carry out operations on the data to get it into their required state, without needing to understand all the details of how it is done.\nAnother project has been developing a new system for keeping track of research funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the data that comes out of this research. This was built to replace the previous SharePoint based system that users found slow and difficult to navigate. This was my first big project and I learnt a lot about web development very quickly. I found that on the job experience was invaluable in this respect and I was able to pick things up much faster by working on a real project. Many users rely on this system as part of their day to day work so it was so exciting when we finally swapped from the old system to our new one in November last year. Since then, I have been involved in making several updates to the system to add new functionality and fix issues. The feedback we have received so far has been positive, saving users time, improving usability and making collaboration easier.\nThrough these projects, and other pieces of work, I’ve learnt a lot about software engineering principles and best practice, as well as getting to grips with a big variety of tools. One of my favourite things about my work is that it supports the environmental research community. This makes it even more enjoyable as I feel like I’m contributing to important issues such as climate change. I never would have expected that I would be working as a Software Engineer, especially while I was struggling through my programming module at University, but I’m very glad to be doing it!\nElle joined the CEDA team in 2019 via the STFC Graduate Scheme. Previously, Elle completed a BSc in Physics with year abroad at Durham University (2015-19).\nTo find out more about career opportunities at STFC, take a look here. "

A new addition to NASA\u0026#39;s Earth Observatory, [the Natural Hazards section](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/), contains images and information about major environmental events that are potentially hazardous to human populations. Initially, the Earth Observatory team will track five categories of natural hazards: wildfires, severe storms, floods, volcanic eruptions, and major air pollution events (dust storms, smog, and smoke). The images-acquired by NASA Earth Science Enterprise and Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite missions-are freely available to the public as well as news media. \u0026#34;We are pleased to be able to share these spectacular new images with the world in a timely manner,\u0026#34; said Michael King, EOS senior project scientist at NASA\u0026#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center. \u0026#34;We are often able to publish these images within a matter of hours after they are acquired by the satellite sensors.\u0026#34; \u0026#34;We believe the combination of high quality and moderate to high resolution of the scenes we publish demonstrates the significant technological advancements NASA has made in the design of satellite remote sensors,\u0026#34; King continued. \u0026#34;We hope the public finds the images informative as well as useful for educational purposes.\u0026#34; Earth scientists around the world use NASA satellite imagery to better understand the causes and effects of natural hazards. The goal in sharing these new images in the Earth Observatory is to help people visualize where and when natural hazards occur, and to possibly help mitigate their effects. There are plans to expand the section\u0026#39;s scope to include other types of natural hazards information, such as earthquakes, coastal erosion, and landslides. The Earth Observatory is managed by the EOS Project Science Office, and funded by NASA\u0026#39;s Earth Science Enterprise.

        content: "News Release - Monday 3rd September 2007 A scientist studying amphibians is the ten thousandth user to access a national database of weather and atmospheric measurements. Kerry Murton from Cardiff University\u0026rsquo;s Llysdinam Field Centre has been investigating the affect of climate change on the timing of events in the lifecycle of newts. Kerry is using data from the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) at the Science and Technology Facilities Council\u0026rsquo;s (STFC) Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Kerry Murton checking pitfall traps Phenology is the timing of events in the life cycle, eg migration or breeding, and in the amphibian life cycle phenology it is largely driven by factors such as moisture and temperature. For her PhD Kerry is conducting a site-specific study at Llysdinam Pond on newt migration, courtship behaviour, egg laying and larval development. She is also contributing to a long term dataset on newt movements to and from the pond. Newt migrations at Llysdinam have been monitored since 1980 when the pond was encircled with a drift fence and pitfall traps enabling daily monitoring of the numbers of newts entering and exiting the pond. A male smooth newt Kerry will be accessing the BADC to get the UK\u0026rsquo;s Meteorological Office rainfall and temperature data for her local weather station which was established at Llysdinam, mid Wales, in 1988. The weather data will be matched to the records of newly metamorphosed juvenile newts, \u0026rsquo;efts\u0026rsquo; leaving the pond annually. One aim is to investigate how the number of \u0026rsquo;efts\u0026rsquo; leaving the pond over the past 26 years varies with recorded temperature and rainfall data to determine which conditions are more favourable to them. In addition, newt courtship surveys and egg laying data will be analysed against the weather data. Torchlight surveys for the newt courtship dance were carried out regularly each week and data on newt egg laying over the season were collected. Previous research on adult newt migrations to the pond found a change in the timing of arrival over the years. Milder spring temperatures have resulted in first arrival dates being five weeks earlier than in the 1980s, with male palmate newts arriving increasingly earlier than the other groups. Kerry said, \u0026ldquo;In my research I aim to find out what the consequences of this earlier arrival are for courtship timing and egg laying and ultimately breeding success. The ability of animals and plants to adapt to climate change will have a large impact on the biodiversity of the UK\u0026rdquo;. The number of adult newts breeding at the pond varies annually, with between 1500 and 3500 newts arriving at the pond each year. The project focuses on palmate newts Triturus helveticus and smooth newts T. vulgaris, although small populations of great crested newts T. cristatus, common toads Bufo bufo and common frogs Rana temporaria also breed at the pond. Although the smooth newt is more widely distributed in the UK, the smaller palmate newt is more common in Wales and makes up 75% of the population at Llysdinam pond. The BADC, hosted by STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire, is the Natural Environment Research Council\u0026rsquo;s (NERC) designated data centre for atmospheric sciences, and is part of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. It holds many atmospheric datasets totalling more than a 100 Terabytes of data in over 80 million files, from a variety of sources, including satellites, balloons, aircraft, computer models of the atmosphere and ground-based instruments. The data are accessible free to non-commercial research projects through the BADC website. Dr Sam Pepler, who manages the Data Centre at RAL says, \u0026ldquo;We have many users researching a diverse range of subjects including climate change and its impact on ecology and water resources, through to medical research and social issues, like housing. NERC values the data it produces and ensures that access is provided to as many different researchers as possible and that the data is kept for posterity.\u0026rdquo; The role of the BADC is to assist UK atmospheric researchers to locate, access and interpret atmospheric data and to ensure the long-term integrity of atmospheric data produced by NERC projects. The BADC is part of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). NCAS is a NERC established collaborative centre, which supports the national capability in atmospheric science research.

The data held by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) consists of historical records accumulated over decades that provide a valuable resource to support research, survey and monitoring activities and for users in academia, government, the public sector, industry and commerce. The NERC data centres (www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/) are responsible for the long-term management of data and provide access to NERC\u0026rsquo;s data holdings. They also provide support and guidance in data management to NERC funded researchers.\nThe NERC has recently launched a new Science Information Strategy (www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/sis.asp). It has been created to provide the framework for NERC to work more closely and effectively with the scientific communities, both internal and external, in delivering data and information management services to support its five year science strategy, the Next Generation for Planet Earth (www.nerc.ac.uk/about/strategy/ngscience.asp).\nA key part of working more closely and effectively with the scientific community is understanding the requirements and expectations of existing users, as well any barriers or obstacles that can prevent other people from becoming users. To this end NERC will be seeking the views of the wider community to discover if the activities of the NERC data centres are meeting their needs.\nThe views of existing and potential users are extremely valuable and we would ask that you take a 10 to 15 minutes to take part in the consultation. The result of the initial consultation will provide valuable information to help us plan for future developments and will be the foundation for further dialogue. The initial consultation is via means of an online questionnaire which will be available between the 15th October and the 19th November 2010. It can be found at:\nwww.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/consultation\nDuring the initial online questionnaire you will be asked to indicate if you would be willing to take part in a subsequent phone interviews, this is entirely voluntary.\nThe results of the study will be made available through the NERC website early 2011.\nMark Thorley and Jeremy Giles\nNatural Environment Research Council\nBADC Helpdesk 6th October 2010"

        content: " Maintaining, upgrading and continually preparing for the future developments of world class data analysis infrastructure for the environmental research community is an essential part of CEDA\u0026rsquo;s ongoing service. This week saw the successful completion of a major system upgrade by our dedicated systems team, paving the way for the future of CEDA\u0026rsquo;s JASMIN infrastrucutre.\nOur system team worked a very long and intense day on Wednesday, the culmination of several months of planning to ensure that disruption was kept to a minimum and that the JASMIN core network is kept trouble-free. It was the first such scheduled downtime since February 2015.\nJonathan Churchill and his team of Cristina del Cano Novales and Ian Wester in STFC\u0026rsquo;s Scientific Computing Department were joined by Stas Rudashevsky, tech support from network equipment supplier Mellanox, who flew in specially from Israel to ensure everything went smoothly, and Linda Edmondson from Panasas who provided valuable remote support from California to bring a large part of the storage back online. World wide support indeed for a world leading infrastructure!\nFast iSCSI and NetApp replacement The work focussed on essential firmware upgrades on 28 Mellanox 10/40Gb network switch/routers (about half of the infrastructure) to fix ~3 critical bugs which had required workarounds for the past 18 months.\nEach switch required 3 upload, install and reboot cycles of about 1 hour each. The other half of the infrastructure had been upgraded transparently to users in the run up to the downtime.\nMulti Terabits per Second cableing These switch/routers connect all the Panasas storage, the cloud infrastructures and around 1000 virtual and physical machines, so this work required careful planning and sequencing to take all dependancies into account, as the devices form a dynamic fabric which reacts to heal any changes.\nNew Dell server blades As a result of the upgrades we now have stable redundant routers for the VM block storage and hence able to release the small fast iSCSI storage which we hope will improve relational database performance, and the replacement system for our 3 yr old NetApp in time for its end of life in December. The upgrade has also stabilised the dynamic routing algorithms, (important as there are ~1,000 ethernet routes inside JASMIN !) allowing us to grow the network - eg to add the additional 1,000 cores to LOTUS and our Object storage . In addition the upgrade will allow us to move forward with our VXLAN support allowing us to grow the size of the JASMIN cloud networks transparently to users, as well as introduce management and Software Defined Networking (SDN) tool (Mellanox\u0026rsquo;s NEO) to help us with our migration to OpenStack.\nThis bespoke high-performance network is one of the key features of JASMIN which makes it a world-class infrastructure for large-scale environmental science. Presentations given at the recent JASMIN Conference provide more information about the range of science being undertaken and the innovative approaches enabled by JASMIN.\nWe would like to thank all involved for ensuring that the work went smoothly, and you, our user community for your understanding and patience while this essential work was carried out.\nAll systems should now be running as normal, but if you have found any new issue, please report any problems to our helpdesk at: support@ceda.ac.uk.\nCEDA / JASMIN Team"

This describes the main features of the catalogue and new users are encouraged to read this before starting to explore the catalogue.\nThe new catalogue is designed around the following key linked features: Datasets, Dataset Collections, Projects, Instruments, Platforms and Computations.\nDataset records provide detailed information about specific datasets held in the CEDA archives - for example, data from a particular instrument on a field campaign; while Dataset Collections bring together series of these datasets, linked by some common theme - e.g. a field campaign, a particular instrument or facility.\nProject records provide background information about why the dataset was produced and may also have links to supporting services for ongoing projects that CEDA is actively supporting - such as group workspaces or information about depositing data for the project participants.\nInstruments, Platforms and Computation records give relevant information about how and sometimes wheredata were produced. For example, these can tell you about an institution\u0026rsquo;s chemistry information mounted on a research aircraft, or a particular NWP model run on a supercomputer. Users can then navigate from one record type to another to find either related data and/or related background information.\nBegin exploring our new catalogue here Further help \u0026nbsp; If you require further assistance or would like to make any comment about the new interface, please contact the CEDA helpdesk and we will be happy to assist where possible.\nHow the old and new catalogues compare \u0026nbsp; Most of the new catalogue\u0026rsquo;s main features are synonymous with our previous catalogue, but have been made ISO standards compliant by adjusting and standardising the content of the different record types in the catalogue. In some cases there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a direct mapping and so the information has been split where needed.\nThe table below shows how the items in the old catalogue have been mapped to the new service:\nOld catalogue New catalogue Data Entity maps to Dataset Collection Deployment maps to Dataset Activity maps to Project Data Production Tool for observational tools maps to Instrument for models maps to Computation Observation Stations for observational stations maps to Platforms for computer hardware maps to Computation Past dataset citations and DOI links \u0026nbsp; With the switch to the new catalogue service CEDA are taking careful steps to maintain the traceability of our data and how people may have previously cited data in our archive in publications. To do this CEDA has:\nadded the URLs for the old catalogue entries onto the relevant catalogue entry in the new service - under \u0026ldquo;previous record identifiers\u0026rdquo; mapped content from the citations given in the old records over to the new service to ensure that the citations are nearly identical, with the only real change being the URL used in the citation string now points to the new service undertaken to provide URL redirects from the old catalogue to the relevant record in the new catalogue service when the old service is turned off undertaken to ensure that all DOIs will correctly map to the relevant entry in the new service - very little content has changes on the relevant records, thus maintaining the required elements for these citations. Future developments \u0026nbsp; At present the new catalogue is largely a like for like replacement of the present catalogue and you can still explore the old catalogue here. The old catalogue will be switched off around the start of November this year to allow people to transition from the old catalogue to the new service. However, we are planning on continuing to improve the new service by:\nreviewing the catalogue content and enhancing the dataset information improving the connections to the archive to allow greater discovery of more relevant data quickly and easily enhancing the search facility to allow searches, for example by temporal and geographical extent More information about the CEDA catalogue \u0026nbsp; As mentioned above, the new service has been designed to comply with international standards which allows more greater portability of the catalogue information to external services - such as the NERC Data Catalogue Service. The standard CEDA has followed is a GEMINI 2 and INSPIRE compliant standard with an environmental focus, built around version 3.4 of the MOLES (Metadata Objects Linking Environmental Sciences) model, developed by CEDA.

        content: "The CEDA archive has published a valuable new dataset this week, called HadUK-Grid. This dataset, provided by the Met Office, is a collection of gridded climate variables derived from the network of UK land surface observations. What makes this dataset notable is that it spans a long time-series (1862-2017) and is freely available to download from our archive.\nSome of the observations underwent a ‘rescue mission’ where they were digitised from historic weather station records. These observations have been collated to generate values on a regular grid from the irregular station network, taking into account factors such as latitude and longitude, altitude and terrain shape, coastal influence, and urban land use. Variables include air temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, mean sea level pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, vapour pressure, days of snow lying, and days of ground frost.\nThe density of the station network used varies through time, and for different climate variables — for example, for the temperature variables the number of stations rises from about 270 in the 1910s to 600 in the mid-1990s, before falling to 450 in 2006. The station observations used to produce the grids have undergone a quality control process which corrects or removes erroneous data. The gridded data sets are based on the archive of UK weather observations held at the Met Office.\nBut why use gridded data, like HadUK-Grid? Some advantages include:\nregional values can be produced for any arbitrary area (county, unitary authority, river catchment, etc.) with greater accuracy and consistency they facilitate the creation of contoured or colour-shaded maps, e.g. of 30-year averages they can be combined with other spatial data, such as transport routes, to study links between them less reliance on a weather station network that is irregularly spaced and changing with time reliable climate estimates for points some distance from weather stations, e.g. in upland areas a consistent series of climate data, enabling comparisons to be made in time and space a complete series of climate data, without missing values (a problem to which weather stations can be prone) The primary purpose of these data are to facilitate monitoring of UK climate and research into climate change, impacts and adaptation. Data can be accessed here and more information can be found on the Met Office website.\nThe data have been created by the Met Office with financial support from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in order to support the Public Weather Service Customer Group (PWSCG), the Hadley Centre Climate Programme, and the UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) project. The data recovery activity to supplement 19th and early 20th Century data availability was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC grant ref: NE/L01016X/1) project \u0026ldquo;Analysis of historic drought and water scarcity in the UK\u0026rdquo;."

        content: "New JASMIN Accounts Portal: 8th February 2017\nCEDA has been developing a new portal for JASMIN/CEMS users to manage their accounts. This will bring greater clarity for current JASMIN/CEMS users and introduce new functionality for the management of Group Workspaces, Projects VMs and JASMIN Cloud tenancies.\nWe plan to launch this new service on 8th February. Both current and future JASMIN/CEMS users should read the following announcement to prepare for this change.\nWhy are we doing this? \u0026nbsp; JASMIN now offers several different types of service, including traditional batch compute (LOTUS), Group Workspaces, bespoke VMs and self-service cloud tenancies. In order to provide a clear separation between JASMIN services (access to compute and storage resources) and CEDA services (access to datasets in the CEDA archive), we are separating JASMIN accounts from CEDA accounts. The JASMIN Accounts Portal is where users will manage their new JASMIN accounts, and addresses a growing need for more advanced account management that goes beyond the present system that CEDA have employed to date. It will also allow us to support JASMIN users who do not need access to the CEDA archive, such as those who only need access to Group Workspaces or JASMIN Cloud tenancies.\nThe new system will:\nProvide a modern portal for users to manage their JASMIN accounts Streamline the process of applying for access to JASMIN resources Streamline the approval process for GWS and VM managers Allow cloud tenants to manage the users in their tenancy Simplify the choice of login accounts Provide clarity for users between JASMIN services and CEDA archive services What will happen? \u0026nbsp; On the go-live date users will notice the following changes:\nExisting JASMIN/CEMS users will continue to have their present access to JASMIN/CEMS system Existing users will have their details ported over to the new JASMIN Accounts Portal and be asked to complete the migration by activating their new JASMIN account and linking to their CEDA account JASMIN, CEMS and \u0026ldquo;commercial\u0026rdquo; login will be merged into one generic \u0026ldquo;JASMIN login\u0026rdquo; service New users will apply for JASMIN accounts and resources via the new portal only External authorisers will have a new, streamlined portal through which to grant/reject resource applications A new set of Terms and Conditions for JASMIN users will also be issued What support will there be available? \u0026nbsp; The CEDA/JASMIN team have been testing the new portal to make it as intuitive as possible and have prepared \u0026ldquo;how-to\u0026rdquo; videos and new documentation to guide users through the new portal.\nAccess to this new documentation has been integrated into the new JASMIN Accounts Portal with simple and easy to use help tool.\nShould users encounter any further issues they will be able to contact the CEDA helpdesk for further support.\nWhat will I be able to do in the new portal? \u0026nbsp; Users will be able to manage their JASMIN account and access to resources on JASMIN including:\nLogin, scientific analysis and transfer servers and the LOTUS cluster Group Workspaces Project-specific Virtual Machines Cloud Tenancies Access to CEDA Archive datasets will, however, remain with the user\u0026rsquo;s CEDA account. Access to some (but not all) restricted datasets associated with a user\u0026rsquo;s CEDA account will be possible via the JASMIN filesystem by linking their CEDA and JASMIN accounts.\nWhat if I have further questions? \u0026nbsp; The transition process should be a smooth one for all users of the JASMIN system, with no noticeable changes to user login or service access. Should you have any questions following the switch-over please consult the JASMIN online help pages in the first instance or send a message to our helpdesk: support@ceda.ac.uk"

        content: "We are pleased to announce the release of a new JASMIN service providing access to Jupyter notebooks. What is the JASMIN Notebook service?\nThe JASMIN Notebook service provides access to Jupyter Notebooks in the web browser. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document containing live code and visualisations that can be viewed and modified in a web browser. These documents can be shared, often using GitHub, and many projects distribute example code as Jupyter notebooks. Users interact with their notebooks using the open-source Jupyter Notebook server application.\nWhat can you use it for?\nThis service is primarily intended for interactively producing visualisations of existing data using Python. Your notebooks have read-only access to all the archive and GWS data you can access from the JASMIN Scientific Analysis servers. Using a web browser means that you can iterate quickly on plots without having to move image files around. Previously, the only way to look at visualisations you made on JASMIN was to copy them to your machine or use X11 Forwarding - with the new Notebook service, you no longer have to do this. Limitations\nThis service is currently in a beta/testing phase - meaning access to the service is limited and unknown issues/bugs in the software may be present. During this phase of the service, only 50 concurrent accesses to the service will be allowed at any one time. If this limit is reached, you will not be able to access the service until the number of accesses reduces. As this service is new, please also be understanding if there are teething issues. We hope this service will be useful to users and would love to hear about your experience of using the service. We welcome any feedback and/or improvements to the service and its help documentation. Read more about how to get access to the JASMIN notebook service here: https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4851-jasmin-notebook-service"

        content: "Experts at the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) have launched a new technical blog for sharing expertise about how we manage petabytes of data. \u0026nbsp; The CEDA team has a wealth of expertise in world-leading data management practices and software engineering that we use to support the environmental science community. We want to share our knowledge, best practices and lessons learnt with others - so have launched a new CEDA Technical Blog. This blog aims to showcase how our team uses open source tools to efficiently manage multi-petabytes of environmental data and collaborate with international research projects working on society’s most pressing environmental issues.\nCEDA staff have research backgrounds from environmental science domains such as atmospheric and climate science, earth observation, geography/geology, oceanography, physics, computer science and more. The team is made up of various job roles including; software engineers, data scientists, dev-ops, user support roles, to name a few. The work our experts do is world-leading in the environmental science and data curation domains, so they are well placed to share technical information with interested communities. To kick off the blog, we’ve written about some technical challenges our Software Engineers are working on solving. The topics discussed in the blog may be experimental and unfinished.\nSearch Futures - by Richard Smith, Senior Software Engineer\nWe have been looking around for a flexible, scalable standard that would allow us to expose the bulk of the CEDA Archive via faceted search. This could then be used to build user interfaces and enhance search services at CEDA. In this blog post, we consider the feasibility and suitability of STAC and discuss progress into an Elasticsearch-based implementation.\nWhat is a user? Removing anomalous behaviour from Anonymous access logs - by Mahir Rahman, Undergraduate Year-in-Industry student from University of York The Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project’s goal is to provide open, registration-free, access to essential climate variables. CEDA runs the CCI open data portal, a suite of services to provide access to the CCI datasets held in the CEDA Archive including download and metadata services. Dataset usage is an important metric in understanding uptake and usage of the different datasets however, without requiring users to register, it is difficult to determine distinct users. Recent changes in access patterns have led to spurious user counts when thinking 1 IP = 1 USER. This article looks at methods to determine “normal” thresholds to reduce the impact of the different access patterns on our usage statistics.\nWe have a range of blog posts related to data management and software engineering planned - but if you have any suggested topics, then please get in touch. We hope you enjoy reading more of our blog posts in the future!"

Warming oceans lead to a decline in Antarctic sea ice, increased ocean freshening, sea-level rise, reduced oxygen and CO2 uptake and slow the vertical exchange of waters. This may bring about increased food scarcity, diseases, extreme weather events, loss of coastal protection, and more. It is therefore extremely important to have a detailed understanding of what could happen in the future with a Southern Ocean that is warmer, less salty and is circulating in different ways.\nImage by Angie Agostino from Pixabay These interactions are challenging to simulate accurately in coupled climate models, making it hard to predict changes and consequences. To understand what the models are simulating well and what not so well, researchers need to undertake detailed data analysis and intercomparison. However, the immense size of these datasets means that simply examining the model output is a technical challenge all of its own. With the help of JASMIN, detailed analysis of the Southern Ocean can be undertaken, using the largest ever climate model dataset (the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 - CMIP6, clocking in at over 90 Petabytes!).\nDr Andrew Meijers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), has been working with JASMIN’s Community Cloud computing platform to analyse Southern Ocean CMIP6 data. “This is a service unique in the UK, that has allowed me to use cutting edge tools to manipulate and explore the extremely large datasets that make up coupled climate model ensembles. This allows for much faster discovery and analysis than was previously possible”, Andrew explains.\nThe research deployed a range of tools to create a unique environment on JASMIN’s Community Cloud. The following tools were used:\nPangeo - an open-source community platform for data analysis for large Earth science datasets. Pangeo can be deployed on the JASMIN Community Cloud to enable use of the tools mentioned below. Jupyter Notebooks - a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The JASMIN Notebook Service uses Jupyter notebook technology. Various Python tools and packages, such as the Xarray package - Python is an open-source programming language which has various packages for data analysis. The xarray package can be used to make working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simpler and more efficient. Dask - a tool used to scale Python packages. It works with the existing Python ecosystem to scale it to multi-core machines and distributed clusters. Dr Meijers research combines the powerful Xarray package for the manipulation of gridded datasets with a Dask backend, allowing the relatively seamless manipulation of extremely large datasets using parallel computation in an interactive environment. JASMIN’s Cloud enables users to dynamically deploy a complete working Pangeo environment using a point and click web interface. This circumvents some of the technical problems involved with setting up such a state of the art interface and allows scientists and researchers to focus on the science rather than deployment issues.\nJASMIN services are essential for this type of large scale analysis of climate model data. Andrew’s research looks at how water masses vary between models and how they change their heat/carbon properties under different climate forcing scenarios. This research will help determine how Southern Ocean properties may change in the future, as well as identify areas where models are underperforming (see Figure 1). This research will ultimately help improve climate models, notably those run by the UK Met Office, and inform governmental and intergovernmental bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is vital to improve understanding of the Southern Ocean’s properties so that we can better prepare for the challenges society may face in future years. The scale and complexity of the datasets means that it would not have been possible without JASMIN.\nTo find out how this new, and potentially very powerful, technology could help you get more out of using JASMIN watch Andrew’s talk here.\nFigure 1: CMIP6 model ensemble average heat content change for various key Southern Ocean water masses south of 20S between the present day and 2100 under the strong climate forcing scenario SSP585. The red line gives the ensemble mean, and the blue envelope one standard deviation around this. This shows that the majority of the warming occurs in the circumpolar deep water, and to a lesser extent in the Antarctic Intermediate and Mode Waters. This is slightly unexpected, as the mode and intermediate waters are traditionally thought to be the water masses where heat is injected into the ocean. The cause of their more modest heat uptake is thought to be due to the thinning of these water masses as the surface ocean warms.

        content: "On Wednesday 26th June, we welcomed 28 JASMIN users to our first ever hands-on interactive training event. The workshop consisted of a short introduction, followed by nine scenario based exercises that encourage good practice for using JASMIN. Participants left the day with a set of common examples of how to use JASMIN efficiently which allows for easy adaptation to suit their individual workflows as appropriate. The day was jam-packed with content; exercises were presented by Matt Pritchard (JASMIN Operations Manager), Fatima Chami (JASMIN User Support) and Ag Stephens (Head of Partnerships), whilst a range of other members of the JASMIN team were also on hand to provide 1-1 support with the exercises. All participants had access to a laptop so they could try out the exercises for themselves - which could have been a recipe for disaster! Luckily, the team was well equipped to deal with any difficulties faced on the day. We have received lots of positive, constructive feedback from the participants and will incorporate this into the current notes and worksheets. These resources, created for this workshop, will be shared freely as soon as possible over the next few weeks and via future workshops. You can see the exercise titles below:\nExercise 1: Accessing JASMIN “sci” machines \u0026amp; how to use them Exercise 2: Copy data to JASMIN to share with collaborators Exercise 3: Processing on the scientific analysis servers Exercise 4: A script to extract 1 variable from a file in the ERA-Interim dataset Exercise 5: Batch running the extraction script on LOTUS Exercise 6: Managing a multi-step workflow Exercise 7: Building your own Python 3 environment Exercise 8: Compiling and running parallel Fortran code to run on LOTUS Exercise 9: Optimising storage usage on JASMIN (scratch/GWS/tape) We also intend on running this workshop regularly at RAL in the future, with the initial aim being quarterly. We may also take it ‘on tour’ to our partner organisations (such as NCAS-Leeds, Met Office, CEH), so please do let us know if this is something you would be interested in.\nThanks to all who supported and attended our first hands on event - here’s to many more!"

        content: "Message forwarded from Dr. Charles H. Jackman, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. ================================================================================ October 25, 2001 UARS Colleagues: We have generally positive news to report. Please send this on to others as I may not have everyone on my UARS distribution list. The latest news regarding the UARS Mission is given below: MEETING AT NASA HEADQUARTERS ON OCTOBER 24TH - We had a meeting yesterday at NASA Headquarters with Mike Luther (Deputy Associate Administrator) and others in Code Y. We discussed the status of the UARS and the many changes that are ongoing in the project as well as this option. Generally we received positive feedback. We have been told to proceed with the \u0026#34;Traceability Mission\u0026#34; option (see below) for the foreseeable future. The total cost of the \u0026#34;Traceability Mission\u0026#34; option including mission and science operations is about $3.7M. For comparison, the cost of the UARS mission and science operations was about $15.4M in FY01. We have received $2M so far that is being applied to the mission operations. UARS \u0026#34;TRACEABILITY MISSION\u0026#34; OPTION - This option will be primarily focussed on providing validation/calibration measurements for upcoming future missions. We hope to provide UARS validation measurements for the following future FY02 missions: TIMED, SAGE III, ENVISAT-1, ADEOS II, EOS Aqua, and SORCE. If we are successful in FY02, it may be possible (with Code Y approval) to continue for an additional time period beyond September 30, 2002, and overlap other missions. UARS INSTRUMENT DATA COLLECTION - Instrument science observations resumed on October 1st after being shutdown from September 24-30. We are now in a \u0026#34;baseline operational mode\u0026#34; wherein we have 15 contacts/day (once per orbit) as compared with 30 contacts/day (twice per orbit) in FY01. This allows the collection of about 20-30% of the possible data. Since the HALOE instrument uses the remaining working part of the tape recorder, practically all of the HALOE observations are being collected. There is enough power to operate HALOE on about 2/3rds of the days. After the launches of new missions, with an appropriate time for outgassing and new instrument checks, the UARS instruments will be operated in an \u0026#34;intense validation/calibrational mode\u0026#34; for two-week observational periods. During these periods, the UARS instruments will have 30 contacts/day so that 50-55% of the data would be collected. UARS CENTRAL DATA HANDLING FACILITY (CDHF) - Unfortunately, we will not be able to fund the UARS CDHF beyond November 30, 2001. The UARS CDHF is in the midst of final reprocessing, data archive, and supporting the effort to move to data distribution through a \u0026#34;new\u0026#34; system called PACOR-A. UARS LONG-TERM DATA ARCHIVE - This issue is currently being addressed. It is hoped that ultimately all the UARS data (including L0/L1/L2) will be moved to the DAAC and be compatible with UNIX machines. To complete this effort will require some funding beyond what has been approved. UARS RETRIEVAL - It was decided at the meeting yesterday that there will not be a Space Shuttle retrieval of the UARS. Thanks for your support. I am convinced that the community efforts over these difficult several months. Sincerely, Charles Jackman UARS Project Scientist"

        content: "Earlier this month, three CEDA staff members were presented with awards at the annual ESGF conference. The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) is a collaborative project for distributing climate data, especially from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models. It gives users a unified interface to search for and download data hosted at numerous data centres internationally.\nImage: showing the partners involved with ESGF.\nCEDA Software Engineer, Alan Iwi, was presented a joint award with IPSL’s Guillame Levavasseur for, ‘Exceptional contribution to CDNOT data challenges’. The CMIP Data Node Operations Team (CDNOT) sets requirements on the ESGF infrastructure for delivering the CMIPs. They ran a set of ‘data challenges’ to prepare the federation for the arrival of CMIP6 data. Guillame and Alan worked dedicatedly, over and above what was expected, to fix (often complex) operational and deployment issues.\nThe second award was presented to Ruth Petrie, a CEDA Data Scientist, for ‘Exceptional Service to the CDNOT’. This was related to Ruth’s indispensable contribution made to the operation of the CDNOT, particularly during the ESGF Data Challenges (DC) in preparation for handling the CMIP6 model output. The award stated ‘Without her contribution, it would be very hard to see that the data challenges could have been run successfully, and that the community would be able to make our goal of June 2018 readiness for a CMIP6 opening.’\nFinally, Matt Pryor (JASMIN Cloud Developer) was awarded for his ‘Technical Contribution to the Development of the Container-based ESGF Deployment’. This was related to his dedicated work with the Container Working Team (CWT), who have been developing a fully containerised version of the ESGF software. This has required the integration of a complex set of application components into a completely new deployment and operational framework. Matt worked closely with the team and incorporated key innovations and applied best practice in this new and and fasting moving field - particularly in the application of Kubernetes and the use of Helm Charts. Ultimately, Matt’s work is beneficial to the whole ESGF community as it has made installing and maintaining the ESGF software much easier. This is really important for the future development of the system.\nCEDA has been participating in ESGF for many years and hosts one of the primary search indexes for the federation. CEDA also has one of the largest data holdings for CMIP5 in the federation. We use ESGF software to serve data from the ESA Climate Change Initiative and Climate Projections data for the EU\u0026rsquo;s Copernicus Climate Data Store.\nAs well as deploying ESGF servers, CEDA staff contribute actively in the ESGF community, including development of the software. Significant areas of recent contributions have included work on load-balanced server deployments, containerised architecture, enhancements to the system for identity management and access control and helping to coordinate activities for CMIP6.\nThe ESGF portal at CEDA can be found at https://esgf-index1.ceda.ac.uk/\nThe ESA Climate Change Initiative Open Data Portal is at http://cci.esa.int/"

It also entails the access to the archived data – including discovery, metadata, formats and interoperability considerations with the relevant standards – as well as the curation processes aimed at improving the information content and the usability of the archived data. In addition to emergent standards technologies and best practice, we would like to use this conference as an opportunity to explore issues of data management planning and archive appraisal.\nWe are also entering the era of big data; for this conference year, we would like to extend a special invite to large-scale scientific archives so we can facilitate discussion of emergent issues across scientific domains. As we move to a new and exciting technology age, we are seeing large-scale collaborations occurring on state of art virtual research environments and novel collaborative infrastructures. We would invite participation from projects, organisations or individuals developing novel data services within or as a result of these environments. This includes smaller bespoke archives wishing to integrate with larger data holdings to generate targeted knowledge and data services.\nProgramme Posters and Exhibitions Objectives and Sessions Committee Speakers Time Tuesday 15th May 08:00 - 09:00 Coffee and Registration outside Pickavance Lecture Theatre 09:00 - 09:30 Introduction to PV2018 Tony Hey Conference Chair,\u0026nbsp;

STFC Scientific Computing Department 4 The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) was formed in 1982 by the major space agencies of the world to provide a forum for discussion of common problems in the development and operation of space data systems. It is currently composed of eleven member agencies, twenty-eight observer agencies, and over 140 industrial associates.Since its establishment, it has been actively developing Recommendations for data- and information-systems standards to promote interoperability and cross support among cooperating space agencies, to enable multi-agency spaceflight collaboration (both planned and contingency) and new capabilities for future missions. Additionally, CCSDS standardization reduces the cost burden ofspaceflight missions by allowing cost sharing between agencies and cost-effective commercialization. CCSDS 4 PTAB - Primary Trustworthy Digital Repository Authorisation Body Ltd: PTAB, incorporated by the same experienced international group of digital preservation experts who developed ISO standards 14721, 16363 and 16919, has been accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies of India (NABCB) to conduct ISO 16363 audits worldwide utilizing ISO standard 17021, as extended by ISO 16919. ISO processes ensure that any approved audit organisation accredited by a National Accreditation Board, may conduct audits worldwide and any certification that body grants, is accepted worldwide PTAB Conference Objectives\u0026nbsp; Facilitate Science Archives and Data Service Providers sharing knowledge, experiences, and lessons learnt and best practices.\u0026nbsp; In addition to fostering cooperation in the areas of Data Exploitation, Preservation and archived Data Stewardship. Address key emerging issues for science archives including but not limited to Open Data, Big Data, Managing Heterogeneity, Data Management Planning, Data Usability, Exploitation and Impact. Provide a forum for organisations dealing with preservation of own data and value adding to present the status of their activities, plans and expectations. In PV2018 we particularly welcome input from a broad range of science archives and data providers. In addition to space data archives we would like to extend a special invitation to. Large science facilities from different domains to facilitate discussion of our common challenges. Specialist science archives and data service providers who are integrating data with space based observation to produce innovative data services. Session 1: Data stewardship approaches to ensure long-term data and knowledge preservation and data standards. Chairs: \u0026nbsp;Brian Matthews, Richard Moreno, Harald Rothfuss and David Giaretta In this session, we consider the best practises for the long-term preservation of the data and other results associated with research across the preservation lifecycle, from the submission of data packages for preservation, to the access of data products.\u0026nbsp; This includes the organisational structures, policies and standards adopted by data centres and archives to assure cost-effective preservation, together with risk management, uncertainty quantification, quality assessment and the evaluation of preservation capabilities.\u0026nbsp; Further, we will consider novel architectures and tools used to realise different preservation strategies, and standards, tools and languages to capture the preservation context, including the preservation of data formats, the use of identifiers, metadata, semantics, data provenance, quality and uncertainty.\u0026nbsp;\nTopics for this session include: Architectures and tools for curation and preservation Standards for preservation access and exploitation; including uncertainty and risk Policy, exploitation and preservation strategies Risk assessment and appraisal of data value Session 2: Adding value to data and facilitation of data use Chairs: Tom Stein, Nancy Ritchey, Reta Beebe, Richard Hilton and Esther Conway In this session, we consider activities that add value to archived data, facilitate their use or produce novel data services. Data archivists often focus most of their energy on creating well-formed, well-documented archives with the expectation that they will be available for the next 50 to 100 years. However, archived data are meaningless if they cannot be easily retrieved, understood, and used. As a result we would like to invite submissions from projects or archives who rising to the challenge of enhancing data in order to facilitate exploitation of data assets.\nTopics for this session include:\u0026nbsp; Added value services and applications on top of archives Techniques and tools for facilitating data access and use Approaches to supporting knowledge discovery Integrating user feedback into archives and repositories Validation and reanalysis of historic data sets Integration of new data sources and different types of data \u0026nbsp; Return on investment for value add services Session 3 2017: Virtual Research Environments for science data exploitation and value adding Chairs: Christophe Arviset, Mirko Albani, Phil Kershaw and Pascal Lecomte\u0026nbsp; This session will consider new challenges, activities and research related to Virtual Research Environments or Collaborative Environments. While Massive data growth is calling for a new paradigm, with a shift towards \u0026ldquo;bring the user to the data\", where scientists can bring their own code and run it where the data actually reside, instead of downloading the data and run their analysis on their computer. There is also an increased need for data, associated documentation and software long-term preservation and accessibility, for scientists to be able to re-run data analysis that was initially applied on the data. Last, scientists are now expecting to share not only their data, but also their software and the results of their research activities, and to work with their collaborators in an easy and effective manner, regardless of their location.\nTopics for this session include:\u0026nbsp; Thematic and science data exploitation platforms Collaborative virtual research environments Collaborative workflows and collection of data provenance Provision of software as a service, enabling software long term preservation and use Management of associated documentation management and data access Archival of data from shared environment Session 4: Data preservation in practice: past (present) and future Chairs: Jamie Shiers, Kevin Ashley and Eberhard Mikusch The purpose of this session is to examine existing practices and systems and highlight what has been learnt, including how to best benefit from collaboration between projects and/or disciplines. It will also look forward and attempt to understand how new developments and/or technologies and/or tomorrow's data volumes might influence or even constrain how things will be done in the future. Data preservation is not a static field: we wish to use this session to explore what we\u0026nbsp;have learnt from previous migrations and to consider how to best prepare for the future, including potentially disruptive scenarios. We would also like to facilitate discussion on how different services involved in LTDP interplay and to use this opportunity to consider how we measure success and respond to requirements from funding agencies, such as those for F.A.I.R. data management.\u0026nbsp;\nTopics for this session include: Lessons from production systems, data curation, certification, migration between technologies, data re-use and sharing etc. Future outlook: the promise and threats resulting from new technologies including how to guard against disruptive changes. Archival preservation strategy heterogeneity or aiming for homogeneity. On-going or potential areas of cooperation in data preservation, access and reuse, including data transfer between and sharing across archives; What to preserve, balancing scientific, educational and cultural motivation in relation funding: now and in the longer term. Data at risk: examples of data not currently preserved or at risk for technical, financial or other reasons. \u0026nbsp;\nConference Chairs Conference Chair: Tony Hey - Chief Data Scientist STFC\nConference Co- chair: Harald Rothfuss - EUMETSAT\nOrganising Committee Head of Organising Committee: Caroline Callard \u0026ndash; STFC/RALSpace\nEsther Conway \u0026ndash; STFC/CEDA\nBrian Matthews \u0026ndash; STFC/SCD\nPoppy Townsend \u0026ndash; STFC/CEDA\nRichard Hilton \u0026ndash; \u0026nbsp;Satellite Applications Catapult\nAnastasia Bolton \u0026ndash; \u0026nbsp;Satellite Applications Catapult\nJan Fillingham - NCEO\nScientific Programme Committee Head of Scientific Programme Committee: Esther Conway - CEDA\nDavid Giaretta - APA\nBrian Mathews - STFC\nRichard Moreno- CNES\nNancy Ritchey - NOAA\nTom Stein - NASA PDS\nReta Beebe - NASA PDS\nChristophe Arviset - ESA ESAC\nMirko Albani - ESA ESRIN\nPascal Lecomte - ESA Climate Change Office\nKevin Ashley - DCC\nJamie Shiers - CERN\nEberhard Mikusch - DLR\nRobert Elliott - RAL Space\nPhil Kershaw \u0026ndash; CEDA Richard Hilton - Satellite Applications Catapult\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nProfessor Anthony John Grenville Hey CBE FREng FIET FInstP FBCS \u0026nbsp;- \u0026nbsp;STFC Chief Data Scientist and PV2018 Conference Chair: Tony Hey led the UK's e-Science Programme from March 2001 to June 2005.

Dr Hugh Mortimer currently directs his own research into the development of a novel spectrometer for the analysis of atmospheric gases, but is also involved in various other international projects including the calibration climate change monitoring instrument; the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) based on the satellite Sentinel 3 and the Sea Surface Temperature monitoring instrument, SISTeR which is being operated from the Cunard\u0026rsquo;s, Queen Mary 2.\nCarlo Buontempo - Copernicus Department, C3S Section ECMWF: Carlo Buontempo coordinates the activities of a number of international contracts working on the interface between climate science and decision making in sectors ranging from energy to city planning. Carlo completed a PhD in physics at University of L'Aquila in 2004 then he moved to Canada for his post-doc before joining the Met Office.\nCarlo worked at the Hadley Centre for almost a decade were he led the climate adaptation team and more recently the climate service development team. In this role he led numerous projects involving climate change adaptation and regional modelling in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America. In 2012 Carlo became the scientific coordinator of EUPORIAS, and project funded by the European Commission through the 7th framework programme.\nRachel Bruce - Director open science and research lifecycle, JISC: Rachel Bruce leads JISC research activities in the area of open science and the creation and management of research across the whole research lifecycle. She works with colleagues across Jisc to set the direction and to help take the many relevant activities (eg open access or open metrics) JISC has in the area of open science and research management to the next stage to ensure we more effectively support UK research and also continue to have fit-for-purpose research infrastructure. By working together with research sector leaders and representatives, including research funders, JISC can ensure policy, practice and digital provision is aligned. I also lead the development of our research strategy, which crosses the whole range of research support we undertake. She believes its is essential to work with colleagues who provide the network, security or content and applications so we can respond to the needs of the research and university sector and prioritise what JISC should deliver for research in the coming years. Another part of her role includes work on international projects, including the European Open Science Cloud, and international partnership, for example the Knowledge Exchange partnership - where JISC works with similar organisations in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands to advance open scholarship.\nSarah Callaghan Programme Manager Centre for Environment Data Analysis, Editor-in-Chief of the Data Science Journal: Dr. Sarah Callaghan, CEDA Senior Researcher and Programme Manager, was appointed Editor-in-Chief of the Data Science Journal The Data Science Journal is dedicated to the advancement of data science and its application in policies, practices and management as Open Data to ensure that data are used in the most effective and efficient way in promoting knowledge and learning.

It appears that the system is permitting writes beyond the initial volume quota, then artificially increasing the quota reported by “df -H” up to a point where writes are no longer possible. The volume quota is initially set when a volume is created; this is recorded in the JASMIN Projects Portal and available to view in the GWS Dashboard at https://mon.jasmin.ac.uk (accounts portal credentials required). This is the true volume quota: it appears that the value reported by df -H has become unreliable in these cases. The suggested course of action for GWS managers is as follows:\nUse the Projects Portal or GWS Dashboard to check the true quota If the “used” value reported by df -H exceeds this value, some data will need to be removed to bring the usage down below the true quota The GWS Scanner UI can help visualise where space is being consumed within a GWS (but take care to note the date of the last scan) Once usage is brought below the true quota, normal operation of the volume should resume We appreciate this may cause some difficulties: the system team is actively engaged with the storage vendor on this issue to find a solution.\nWith apologies for any inconvenience, JASMIN Team"

        content: "On Friday 29th September, the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) hosted key partners from the PRISE project; including a variety of organisations across the UK, Zambia, Kenya and Ghana as part of the UK Stakeholder workshop.\nPRISE - a Pest Risk Information Service, with grant funded through the UK Space Agency International Partnership Programme, - aims to deliver modelling and prediction of crop loss caused by pests (such as insects, mites and plant pathogens) in up to six countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Pests are estimated to cause around a 40% loss of crops to farmers. The work done by PRISE will support those working to reduce the devastating impacts of crop losses on farmers’ livelihoods which can greatly affect their food security. The project will use a combination of Earth Observation satellite data and plant-pest life cycle data to forecast pest outbreaks.\nCEDA provides technical infrastructure to the PRISE project in the form of an unmanaged cloud tenancy on JASMIN, allowing the project to utilise processing and data storage capacity and permit the integration of pest and model data from the archives of the project leaders at theCABI. The CEDA archive will also hold and provide access to validation data for Earth Observation satellite data which will help optimise accuracy. These data will enable the pest risk service to forecast the severity of a pest outbreak, and then communicate this risk, along with mitigation measures, directly to the farmers that could be affected. Alerts could help farmers to use management strategies on their crops before an outbreak causes damage; thus potentially saving their crop and livelihoods.\nState of the art risk forecasting integrating EO and meteorological data with in-situ measurements Figure 2: State of the art risk forecasting integrating EO and met. data with in-situ measurements\nJASMIN, part of a wave of new technologies, has the potential to overcome barriers to exploitation of space data. Fatima Chami (CEDA) gave the delegation a talk on the full capabilities of the JASMIN infrastructure and an overview of current projects running on JASMIN. She highlighted that in addition to providing storage and computational resources for development of services, such as PRISE, JASMIN can also provide access to data and analysis tools on virtual machines over basic low bandwidth SSH (Secure Shell) connections. This allows data to be easily manipulated and analysed remotely, removing the need to transfer data to or install specialist software at local facilities or research institutes. This combination of computing capability and access to a broad range of high volume data, which is not locally available in many African countries, is potentially game changing in terms of the international scientific collaborations and partnerships that it can foster.\nFigure 3: Fatima Chami provides an overview of the JASMIN infrastructure\nThe group were able tour the new RAL Space R100 facilities where the next generation Meteosat 3 components are currently undergoing environmental testing. The delegates then proceeded to the state of the art JASMIN machine room and onto the historic Solar Terrestrial Physics archive held at RAL where they were able to look at early geophysical records of the African continent from the 1950’s .\nPRISE delegation tours of RAL Space facilities provided by Sarah Callaghan, Jonathan Churchill, Dan Peters, Ted Brooke and Matthew Wild Figure 4: PRISE delegation tours of RAL Space facilities provided by Sarah Callaghan, Jonathan Churchill, Dan Peters, Ted Brooke and Matthew Wild\nThe group continued with a walking tour of the Harwell campus where they were able to view Diamond Light Source and ISIS facilities who are undertaking cutting edge research of wider benefit to the international agricultural research community.\nThe PRISE project will gain impact through the international partnerships; bringing together the local experts, scientists and organisations from across Africa with pest modelling expertise of CABI, earth observation and systems development skills of King’s College London, and the environmental consultants Assimila, and the data specialists and facilities of CEDA. It is by crossing the boundaries of scientific disciplines and international communities that the project will drive the next generation of data science and provide sustainable solutions to real world problems."

Storage is an expensive resource at the scale used within JASMIN and consumes significant energy. Your involvement is pivotal in helping us to understand how it is currently being used and how that could be improved.\nPlease also attend our webinar on 8th February 2024 at 12:00 which will explain more about the survey and its aims and new tools available to GWS managers to help with managing their workspace(s).\nZoom link: https://ukri.zoom.us/j/98528692985\nAs a GWS manager you may be managing more than one GWS. In such a case please complete a separate survey for each GWS that you are responsible for. Conversely, if several of you are responsible for one workspace, please coordinate with each other to submit one response per workspace.\nFurther information and instructions are provided at the survey link above.\nThank you! Your contribution will help us gain valuable insights into the usage of group workspace on JASMIN.\nThanks in advance for your cooperation, JASMIN Team"

This will allow a better I/O throughput for intermediate Slurm state files.\nThe LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 05:00 am on 18th October on the day, but any job submitted before 05:00 am with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.\nIMPORTANT**:** No jobs will be accepted by SLURM from 05:00 am on 18th October until the reservation is lifted. Any attempt to submit a job to SLURM will be rejected with the following message: sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Required partition not available (inactive or drain)\nUpdates to software environments (jaspy, jasr, jasmin-sci) The following software environments will have new default versions at 09:00 on 18th October:\njaspy: Python, and other, tools and libraries. jasr: R tools and libraries. jasmin-sci: other tools installed via RPMs The new jaspy software environment will be available on the sci machines, LOTUS and Notebook Service (see below). The new release includes updates to a number of software packages as well as some new tools. The release, labelled as \u0026ldquo;jaspy/3.10/r20220721\u0026rdquo; is described on our Help Page at: https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs.\nThe new jasr software environment, labelled as \u0026ldquo;jasr/4.0/r20220729\u0026rdquo;, will be released at the same time and is also described at the link above.\nTo test the new environments on the \u0026ldquo;sci\u0026rdquo; servers or LOTUS, use:\nmodule load \u0026lt;release_label\u0026gt;\nAfter 09:00 on 18th October the above releases will be the default versions of these software environments. Once the switch has happened, you can activate the new jaspy or jasr release by typing: module load jaspy # for jaspy module load jasr # for jasr\nNote that the previous jaspy release will continue to be available by using its full label: \u0026ldquo;jaspy/3.8/r20211105\u0026rdquo;.\nUpdate to the jasmin-sci software packages will also be released on 18th October.\nIMPORTANT note for NCO/NCL users:\nWe will be removing support for NCO and NCL from jaspy and adding these to jasmin-sci instead, so in order to continue to use these packages you will need to use “module load jasmin-sci” (in addition to loading the jaspy module if required for other packages). In the event that you load both the jasmin-sci module and also the module for an older version of jaspy which still provides these packages, the module loaded last will take priority, so the ordering may affect which package version will run.\nUpdates to the JASMIN Notebook Service (git and bash integrations) The following updates will be made available on the JASMIN Notebook Service (https://notebooks.jasmin.ac.uk):\nPython software kernel: updated to match the latest version of jaspy (see above). Integration with Git: the left-hand panel includes a Git button to enable interaction with remote repositories within the Jupyter environment. Terminal window: a Bash terminal window can now be run from within the Jupyter environment inside your browser. Reboot ext cloud/DTZ firewall A reboot of the external cloud firewall is scheduled in the morning on Tuesday 18th October. Access to the external cloud tenancies will be unavailable during that time. Update to JASMIN T\u0026amp;Cs \u0026amp; Privacy Policy Some changes have recently been made to the JASMIN Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. Please make sure you have read, agree to and abide by these in your use of JASMIN. Links to these can be found in the footer of every JASMIN web-based service and on the JASMIN website, specifically:\nhttps://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/account/conditions/https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/account/privacy/\nOn a regular (roughly quarterly) basis, important updates are applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure (which also hosts the CEDA Archive and associated services) in order to keep them up to date and secure. Servers may need to be rebooted in order for these changes to take effect, so there may be an interruption to JASMIN and CEDA services on this date.\nOn this occasion, due to the nature and extent of the work being carried out, users will not be able to access JASMIN for large parts of the day. This affects the LOTUS batch processing cluster, significant parts of JASMIN storage, and many virtual machines on which services may be running.\nWe advise you to plan your work accordingly to minimise the impact, but please accept our apologies in advance for any inconvenience.\nThank you for your attention.\nBest wishes, JASMIN Team"

This would affect ALL CEDA and JASMIN services, including:\nCEDA Archive and services JASMIN interactive and batch compute. LOTUS queues will need to be fully closed and drained. JASMIN Cloud tenancies Any services operated by third parties us which depend on either the JASMIN Cloud or the gws-access services. We are working with STFC’s Digital Infrastructure group to develop plans for this unavoidable intervention which will ensure that the work is carried out in the least disruptive way possible, including scheduling other maintenance work during the same period.\nThe current outline timetable for the work is as follows:\nw/c 16 October: Normal service, but draining of LOTUS queues may mean queues are closed towards end of week (timing TBC) w/c 23 October: Assume all services “at risk” from Monday. No LOTUS jobs will be allowed to be queued or executed, and some services may be subject to maintenance/pre-shutdown checks. JASMIN services should be considered entirely offline from Wednesday 25th October, as we start to shutdown storage and host services. weekend of 28/29: October: full downtime w/c 30 October: We will begin the process of bringing services back up, but additional scheduled maintenance will be completed before services are made available to users. Some services including the JASMIN cloud may remain offline for most of this week. We will attempt to restore service when possible, subject to the maintenance described above. Updates will be provided via the usual channels about service restoration/availability. Please look out for further notices about this in the coming weeks.\nWith apologies for any inconvenience caused,\nJASMIN Team"

A very significant increase in research efficiency was reported by users as a result of their using BADC data and services, estimated to be worth at least £10 million per annum.\nThe value of the increase in return on investment in data resulting from the additional use facilitated by the BADC was estimated to be between £11 million and £34 million over thirty years (net present value) from one-year’s investment – effectively, a 4-fold to 12-fold return on investment in the BADC service.\nThe qualitative analysis also shows strong support for the BADC, with many users and depositors aware of the value of the services for them personally and for the wider user community.\nFor example, the user survey showed that 81% of the academic users who responded reported that BADC was very or extremely important for their academic research, and 53% of respondents reported that it would have a major or severe impact on their work if they could not access BADC data and services.\nSurveyed depositors cited having the data preserved for the long-term and its dissemination being targeted to the academic community, as the most beneficial aspects of depositing data with the BADC, both rated as a high or very high benefit by around 76% of respondents.\nThe study report\nThe study report is available for download as a PDF file at: http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/di_directions/strategicdirections/badc.aspx\nThe British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) The BADC, based at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK, is the Natural Environment Research Council’s (NERC) Designated Data Centre for the Atmospheric Sciences. Its role is to assist UK atmospheric researchers to locate, access, and interpret atmospheric data and to ensure the long-term integrity of atmospheric data produced by NERC projects. There is also considerable interest from the international research community in BADC data holdings."

The most desired new EO datasets are: MODIS (Terra and Aqua), AVHRR (Various Satellites), IASI (full METOP series), MERIS (ENVISAT) and CALIPSO data products. These will be prioritised when acquiring new datasets for our archives for access on JASMIN/CEMS.\nA number of datasets have been been added to the CEDA EO archive in recent months:\nSCIAMACHY (ENVISAT) Level 1b v7-04 and Level 2 v5-02 data (radiances, vertical columns of trace gases respectively) ; SCIAMACHY measured transmitted, backscattered and reflected radiances from the atmosphere at high resolution between 2004 and 2010 to provide global measurements of trace gases in the troposphere and the stratosphere. MODIS Surface Reflectance Products; MODIS is one of the most requested datasets, and the surface reflectance products (MOD09 and MYD09) derived from multi-spectral reflectance data will be available soon. MERIS (ENVISAT) Level 1B Reduced Resolution data from the 3rd reprocessing. MERIS is a nadir-pointing imaging spectrometer which measures the solar radiation reflected by the Earth, in 15 spectral bands (visible and near-infrared). CEDA holds Reduced Resolution (1.04 km x 1.16 km) data including Level 1B (radiances), and Level 2 (retrieved geophysical parameters) products will be added shortly. METOP-B datasets from IASI, GOME-2 and AVHRR-3. METOP-B, launched in 2012, is the latest in the series of three METOP satellites flown by EUMETSAT. The CEDA archive already holds Level 1 radiance data from these three atmospheric sounding instruments on the METOP-A satellite, along with Level 2 data from IASI. The METOP-B versions of these products have now been added to the archive. Cloud and aerosol data products from CALIOP on CALIPSO are currently being transferred from NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC). These and more new EO products will be available to JASMIN-CEMS users the coming weeks. For more details contact support@ceda.ac.uk or see http://www.ceda.ac.uk/services/dataSearch/"

        content: "The CEDA Archive now holds over 10 Petabytes of satellite data from the Sentinels - this increases in volume at over 7 Terabytes per day. We provide a mirror archive for Sentinel products, duplicating the ESA archives so that data products required by the Earth observation community are easily accessible. We update 13 Sentinel products daily with another 8 being updated monthly - many of these products are essential for researchers studying global issues such as sea surface temperature, air quality, and land-use change. Due to the ever-increasing volume of data, the team makes use of the differing types of archive storage to ensure data is shared in the most cost-effective and user-friendly way. Fast disk holds the latest data so users can access this instantly, older data is stored on tape as this has less user demand and is a cheaper storage solution. The Near Line Archive (NLA) allows users to pull back data from tape to access the data interactively (more information on the NLA in the 2017-18 annual report).\nProviding useful data to the community \u0026nbsp; Many researchers were interested in investigating how COVID-19 lockdowns were changing countries emissions. Sentinel 5P products, which are used for air quality monitoring, were perfect for this. CEDA staff responded to this community need by updating and backfilling many of the relevant products so that comparisons could be made. CEDA has aimed to archive the latest version of Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) data produced by Sentinel 3 satellites. Data released by ESA this year have been downloaded from ESA and NASA to populate the CEDA Archive. The latest version has provided users with access to the earlier products which hadn’t previously been released as well as older products with the updated processing version.\nSatellite image from Sentinel 5p that shows the global levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in February 2019 Satellite image from Sentinel 5p that shows the global levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in February 2020 Images: Satellite images from Sentinel 5p that shows the global levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in February 2019 (pre covid pandemic) versus February 2020 (during covid pandemic). Credit: processing by CEDA staff, ESA Copernicus data Working with external data providers \u0026nbsp; CEDA also archives processed data products such as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for both Sentinel 1 and 2 over the UK. These new datasets take the initial processing task away from users - allowing researchers to immediately start tackling issues such as monitoring wildfires or detecting habitat change, rather than spending time preprocessing the data. These products have grown in size to almost 100 TB and were the largest volume downloaded via the web from the CEDA Archive for any Sentinel products during the last year. These data are produced by the Defra Earth Observation Data Service (EODS) on Microsoft Azure and JNCC Simple ARD Service hosted on JASMIN. During the next year, a new satellite (Sentinel 6) will be launched with sea surface level data expected to be added to the CEDA Archive. The team will build on past experience to ensure these important data are archived in the most efficient way, allowing users access to the most relevant and up to date data. Find out about other work we do in the CEDA Annual Report (20-21). "

If 2PB\u0026rsquo;s were represented by weight (when 1gram = 1GB), the archived Sentinel data would \u0026lsquo;weigh\u0026rsquo; the equivalent of a Rhino - absolutely \u0026lsquo;horn\u0026rsquo;-ormous! In contrast, your average smartphone data capacity would weigh the equivalent of a mouse. See infographic below for more details.\nEach Sentinel mission collects various measurements and images for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring. There will be a total of 7 Sentinel missions, some of which will be comprised of up to 4 satellites. This maximises global coverage. Some Sentinel missions already have 2 satellites in orbit retrieving data - such as Sentinel1A and Sentinel1B.\nCEDA currently have over 100 users downloading Sentinel 1 data and nearly 70 using Sentinel 2 data. CEDA users have downloaded over 500TB via the web. However, this doesn’t take into account the data accessed via JASMIN and group workspaces. As this data is accessed directly via the file system, it is a difficult statistic to produce accurately per user.\nThese ever increasing data volumes have challenged the CEDA archive. To cater for this data deluge, CEDA has developed the Near Line Archive (NLA) system. The NLA is used to archive older data onto a state of the art tape library in the JASMIN infrastructure. This means that the newest data can be made available via instant access. Older data can still be requested and will take no longer than a few days to be made available. The retrieved data is restored to it’s original location in the archive and can be accessed in the same way for a limited period.\nThe CEDA Satellite Data Finder is another recent development. This provides a map application for locating scenes and scans of several datasets held in the CEDA archive. More information can be found here. Behind the scenes is the CEDA OpenSearch service - this provides a simple way to query the catalogue using scripts via html. These are vital tools to allow users to easily find and access data from the huge Sentinel mirror archive.\nThe huge data volumes produced by the Sentinel missions will not slow down with several more satellites due to be launched in the next few years. This is a big data issue that will continue far into the future and CEDA will continue to innovate and apply technologies to allow users to easily find and use this data.\nExtra info:\nSentinel data is publicly available, all you have to do is register for a CEDA account.\nCEDA currently archive the following Sentinel products:\nSentinel 1A and 1B- IW SLC, IW GRDH, EW GRDM, SM SLC Sentinel 2A- L1 MSI Sentinel 3A- L1 SLSTR, L1 OLCI EFR+ERR and L1 SRAL"

Cylc upgrade to version 8 Module environments reviewed Details \u0026nbsp; 1. New set of Rocky9 sci machines \u0026nbsp; These are available for testing interactive processing tasks. It is important that all users consider how the change to Rocky9 might affect their workflows so we encourage you to test your processing tasks interactively at this stage. The following machines are avialable now for testing (NB: final set of host names TBC):\n1 x virtual machine: sci-r9.jasmin.ac.uk 2 x high-mem physical machines: sci-ph-01.jasmin.ac.uk \u0026amp; sci-ph-01.jasmin.ac.uk 2. cylc upgrade \u0026nbsp; Users of cylc workflow manager (currently version 7 under CentOS7) will need to test and if necessary adapt their workflows to cylc version 8 under Rocky9: previous versions are not compatible with the new operating system. Cylc 8 is available on the current cylc server (CentOS7) for testing. Users are therefore encouraged to start testing with Cylc 8 as soon as possible, in case their suites need to be adapted.\nThe newer version can be specified with:\nexport CYLC_VERSION=8Confirm the version at run time with:\ncylc version 8.2.3 To make Cylc 8 the default, add the following to ~/.bash_profile:\nexport CYLC_VERSION=$CYLC_VERSION:-8IMPORTANT: The Cylc 8 web UI requires use of a web browser such as Firefox: this not available yet, so neither “rose edit” nor “rosie go” will work. Please look out for further news on this.\n3. Module environment reviewed \u0026nbsp; Software made available centrally via the module environment under /apps/modulefiles is being reviewed. GNU and PGI compilers will not be migrated to the new system as we believe there is no evidence of use. The GNU compiler is currently available via the JASPY environment and PGI was acquired by NVIDIA1. Please let us know if there is any particular requirement for any Intel library under /apps/modulefiles so that it can be included in the list of packages to migrate.\nPlease let us know about your experience of using the Rocky9 sci machines, by e-mailing JASMIN Support (support@jasmin.ac.uk) and including \u0026ldquo;Rocky9 feedback\u0026rdquo; in the subject line.\nThanks in advance for your cooperation\nCEDA and JASMIN Teams\nThe \u0026ldquo;PGI Compilers and Tools\u0026rdquo; technology is a part of the Nvidia HPC SDK product available as a free download from Nvidia\u0026nbsp; .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;"

        content: "Moving to Rocky Linux 9 \u0026nbsp; For the past few weeks and months we have been preparing for a change of operating system version on JASMIN. We are now sharing our plans and progress with you, so that you are aware of the remaining changes about to happen. We can then keep you up to date with further progress as the migration gets underway.\nPlease note the following sources of information which we would invite you to follow over coming weeks:\nJasmin-users email list CEDA news items and status page A JASMIN help document\u0026nbsp; covering details of the migration, particularly regarding software packages As with a previous migration completed in 2020, the change of operating system version is needed to make sure that the version in use is current and fully supported, i.e. that package updates are available and important security updates can be obtained and applied to keep the platform secure.\nThe current operating system, CentOS7 is officially end-of-life as of the end of June 2024. We will be moving from CentOS7 to Rocky Linux 9, which is supported until May 2032. Rocky9 should provide a very similar user experience to that provided by CentOS7, but with more recent software packages. Some software may have been removed or replaced during this transition.\nThis change affects JASMIN and CEDA services in several ways, including but not limited to the following:\nComponents of all CEDA Archive and JASMIN web-based services need to be redeployed User-facing service hosts (e.g. login/sci/xfer and LOTUS nodes) all need to be redeployed All of these hosts need appropriate versions of drivers for various hardware and infrastructure components (e.g. storage, network, …) to be configured. The Slurm scheduler used for the LOTUS and ORCHID clusters needs to be adapted to work under Rocky 9, in terms of its own management functions and the worker nodes which it controls. A separate announcement will cover the expansion of LOTUS with new processing nodes: these will be introduced as a new cluster under Slurm, with existing nodes moved from old to new as part of the transition. There will be a limited window in which the 2 clusters will co-exist, during which time the old cluster will shrink in size: the current estimate for this is between July to September 2024, but we will provide updates on this as the new hardware is installed and timescales become clearer. We will endeavour to provide sufficient overlap and temporary arrangements to help users to migrate their workflows. Software made available centrally via the module system and under /apps needs to be made available in versions compatible with Rocky 9. Some software may need to be recompiled. Other software (e.g. run by users or groups, without being centrally managed) may need to be tested and in some cases recompiled in order to work correctly under Rocky 9. Management and monitoring systems need to be updated to operate in the new environment For tenants of the JASMIN Cloud, you should already be aware of our plans to move to use the STFC Cloud as the base platform for the JASMIN Cloud Service. Images are currently in preparation so that new (empty) tenancies will soon be available for tenants to manage the migration of their own virtual machines over to new instances using Rocky 9 images. It is anticipated at this stage that managed tenancies (with tenancy sci machines) will be discontinued as part of this move, so users of those VMs will be advised to use the new Rocky 9 general-use sci servers instead. Much of this work is already underway by teams in CEDA and STFC’s Scientific Computing Department. As a result of extensive work by these teams in recent years to improve the way services are deployed and managed, we are now in a much better position to undertake this kind of migration with as little disruption to users as possible. Some disruption and adaptation by users will be inevitable, however.\nSome services have already been migrated and are already running under Rocky 9, but there is still much work to be done over the coming weeks so please watch this space as we do our best to keep you informed of the progress we’re making, and of any actions you may need to take to minimise disruption to your work on JASMIN.\nThanks in advance for your cooperation,\nCEDA and JASMIN Teams"

In order to meet these targets, it is essential that important air quality datasets are freely available for monitoring how the UK is reducing its emissions. The CEDA Archive is the UK’s dedicated data centre for atmospheric data, our role is to promote good data management practices to enable wider reuse of important data, such as air quality datasets. Air quality is measured across the UK through a network of monitoring stations, research campaigns, atmospheric observatories and satellites. The long-term CEDA Archive holds over 1000 freely available* air quality datasets, such as: Air quality observations on board the specially-adapted aircraft, operated by the FAAM Airborne Laboratory (FAAM), including greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol composition and concentration data. Ground-based air quality measurements collected at a variety of long-term observational facilities, run by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science AMOF, including; Chilbolton - measures particle mass concentrations, carbon dioxide and water vapour concentrations Weybourne - measures nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane and sulfur hexafluoride BT-Tower in London - measures ozone and nitrous oxide Cape Verde - measures carbon dioxide, halocarbon, ozone, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide and more!

Credit: NCAS\nEngaging with science, industry and policy experts \u0026nbsp; Alongside archiving data, the CEDA team is heavily involved with sharing expertise in areas such as data curation, environmental science, and analysis services. Several CEDA staff contribute their expertise to the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s (STFC) Air Quality Network - known as SAQN. This network brings together over 450 members from research, industry and policy - all with an interest in air quality research. The SAQN aims to make the best use of STFC research, capabilities and facilities to address air quality challenges by bringing together this multi-disciplinary community. CEDA’s host institute is STFC, making it well placed to engage with the network. Many members of the network are not from our core user communities, so may not be familiar with CEDA or STFC’s work. We have been helping explain our services and facilitating access to the air quality datasets we hold through meetings, workshops and leaflets. CEDA staff hosted a webinar to the SAQN community explaining to researchers how our services - the long-term data archive, and JASMIN - our globally unique data analysis facility, could be of benefit to their research. We will continue to engage with the network to ensure the community is fully supported by our services and expertise.\nImage 3: Inside the FAAM aircraft.

        content: "Researchers across the UK have been hacking their way through Terabytes of climate data ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow on 1st-12th November 2021. Three virtual hackathon events were run, during May and June 2021, by a range of UK Universities and the Met Office, covering various topics:\nAfrica hackathon Aim: to generate usable and impactful climate narratives for decision makers in East and West Africa CMIP6 data hackathon Aim: to produce cutting-edge research using Climate Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) data, via a variety of projects Energy hackathon Aim: to produce novel solutions for understanding and quantifying climate risks in future energy systems Image caption: some of the hackathon teams explored ways to produce novel solutions for understanding and quantifying climate risks in future energy systems.

Photo by Alexandru Boicu on Unsplash\nAll three hackathons conducted their data storage and analysis on JASMIN - the UK’s data analysis facility for environmental science. Access to climate data (such as CMIP6) held in the CEDA Archive, alongside the processing capabilities of JASMIN, were essential for these hackathons. The hackathon organisers hope to present outputs at COP26 in November and through peer-reviewed papers.\nThe hackathons had over 150 attendees in various teams, investigating topics ranging from climate change to oceanography, biogeochemistry, and more.\nJulia Crook, organiser of the Africa hackathon, said “During the hackathon, we had two groups looking at the effects of climate change, one focused on how it will affect hydroelectric power in Kenya, the other on agriculture in Ghana. Having a shared workspace, alongside analysis tools such as the Notebook Service, with direct access to CMIP6 data was essential for the success of our hackathon.”\nAttendees made use of a variety of JASMIN services, depending on their experience and research needs. James Thomas, organiser of the CMIP6 Data hackathon, said “The ability to give participants access to the JASMIN infrastructure in such a variety of ways meant we were able to cater for a wider range of users at the hackathon, and allow researchers to concentrate on the science as much as possible. Whether this be Jupyter Notebooks for newer users, command line access, or even batch processing systems for our more advanced users, there was something for everyone”.\nA five Terabyte shared workspace allowed teams to collaboratively share and analyse data across the many different academic organisations.\nThe JASMIN Notebook Service provided a web interface where the attendees could interactively analyse data using Python. The Notebook Service is perfect for non-experts - allowing code, documentation and visualisations to be edited and shared. At one point, over 70 notebooks were running simultaneously, the largest number to date!\nTraining accounts were provided to some attendees, allowing short-term access to data and services for those who may not usually be able to access JASMIN. James Thomas explains how these accounts helped “The ability to provide short-term access to researchers without accounts definitely removed a barrier to getting involved. In fact I’m happy to say that based on their experiences during the hackathon, some have now gone on to request full JASMIN accounts and intend to utilise the platform in the future.”\nEnergy hackathon organiser, Hannah Bloomfield, said “I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is anything the JASMIN team could have done to make this easier for us. The online help is really good - once users got into the swing of things they were able to answer their own questions by searching the help pages. The JASMIN team also helped us to get some specialist software, called Gurobi, set up at very short notice - this software turned out to be key to a couple of projects\u0026rsquo; success. We couldn’t have done it without the staff expertise at JASMIN.”\nIf you are interested in using JASMIN for a training event or hackathon, please get in touch with the JASMIN helpdesk.\nThe CMIP6 hackathon has created a template virtual hackathon website for future events. This is freely available with instructions on how to copy and adapt for your specific event.\none hackathon team investigated how future weather would impact agriculture in Ghana.

Future CMIP6 scenarios were used to feed the model to estimate future responses.\nThe Agriculture team looked at how future weather would impact agriculture in Ghana. In particular they looked at how drought intensity and duration changed under future climate predictions. They found droughts of a similar magnitude to the very rare 1983 drought occur a bit more frequently under SSP119 but much more frequently under SSP585.\nCMIP6 Data hackathon \u0026nbsp; Purpose: to produce cutting-edge research using Climate Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) data, via a variety of projects. Organised by: University of Bristol’s Cabot Institute and Jean Golding Institute, in association with the Met Office and universities of Exeter, Leeds and UCL. For further information take a look at the website or these blogs Contact: James Thomas The projects covered in this hackathon are described here, with two specific examples below: Projecting of human heat stress with 3-hourly data from CMIP6 models, using the Universal Thermal Climate Index and nighttime minimum temperatures. JASMIN were very helpful in making as much 3-hourly data from CMIP6 models available as possible at short notice. Our group had diverse experience and interests and we investigated a number of different aspects. The main data extraction was a 2-step process: first using the LOTUS batch compute nodes for intensive processing of the data and then the Notebooks server was used for analysis. One striking result was that under an emissions pathway broadly similar to that if all countries met their current Nationally Determined Contributions, 4% of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s land surface will exceed the threshold for human habitability by 2100 compared to very little today. These results still need to be bias-corrected, and will be included in a planned paper. Impact of climate change on the annual bipolar movements of the arctic tern, a seabird that annually migrates from the Arctic to Antarctic in the longest recorded migration of any animal, integrating CMIP6 modelled climate data with an extraordinary biological dataset. The group of seven PhDs and Post-docs investigated (1) changes to wind support during their migration and the non-breeding season, (2) changes in ocean productivity at key areas where migrating arctic terns refuel, and (3) how observed changes in past sea ice extent may have altered the locations that arctic terns overwinter. The group are continuing this work to investigate how different climate scenarios may impact arctic terns in the future. Energy hackathon \u0026nbsp; Purpose: to produce novel solutions for understanding and quantifying climate risks in future energy systems\nOrganised by: University of Oxford and University of Reading\nFor further details take a look at the website or watch the teams final presentations during the hackathon\nContact: Sarah Sparrow and Hannah Bloomfield\nDuring the hackathon, groups looked into the following topics related to energy systems:\nBuilding a forecasting model to improve predictions of solar power generation over a network of sites in Reading using smart meter data.\nExploring the adverse weather scenarios for renewable energy systems using a dataset from the Met Office with the aim of finding “How extreme is too extreme?”. Team members focussed on visualisation, comparisons, resilience and how the data can be used as an input into a power system model.\nSupporting power system modelers in choosing appropriate meteorological data through climate input sensitivity experiments using a European scale power system model (PyPSAEUR)\nBuilding a workflow to quantify climate risk in power system design using distributed computing. The developed workflow converts hourly climate data to dependent energy variables which can then be used as inputs for a power system model (Calliope). Performing the computation in the distributed framework removes the need to store gridded hourly climate output.\nDownscaling daily reanalysis/climate model output to daily resolution as an input for power system models using a variety of machine learning techniques.\nCEDA and JASMIN \u0026nbsp; The Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) provides services on behalf of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) and the National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO).

        content: "The CEDA team are using data science expertise to support a major project that will warn us of changes in the Earth’s ecosystem.\n​​​Data from Earth observation satellites are being generated at an ever-increasing rate. The Sentinel-3 satellites alone produce up to 2 petabytes of data each year. The quantity and quality of data available can enable innovative environmental science projects but the huge range of data available can also present issues of its own.\n“One of the greatest challenges facing our scientific community is being able to access, process and analyse vast amounts of diverse data. It is only by working effectively with such data that we gain much needed insight into the state of the Earth\u0026quot; said Esther Conway, Senior Earth Observation Data Scientist at CEDA.\nThe Biosphere Atmosphere Change Index (BACI) is a prototype early warning system combining large amounts of data, including satellite observations and ecosystem properties, to provide an indication of how Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystems are interacting and changing.\nIn order to do this, BACI brings together diverse data from a number of different streams and of different scales, from tree ring records to satellite optical and radar data. In order for the scientists using BACI to compare very different types of data, they used infrastructure, software and tools provided by CEDA. “This dataset is being used to identify unexpected changes in the land surface, which may indicate problems that could lead to a potential loss in biodiversity. Once flagged, these changes can be examined more closely to identify the underlying causes and appropriate response. The BACI project is already helping us to understand the human impact on our varying ecosystems, particularly forests and crops. CEDA has been a key part of this process, allowing the BACI team to run computer models to merge satellite data in new ways\u0026quot; said Professor Mat Disney, Professor of Remote Sensing in the UCL Department of Geography and Project Lead for BACI in the UK. The work Professor Disney and his team at ​UCL have carried out on the BACI project has been partly funded by the UK\u0026rsquo;s National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO).​​\nCEDA provided BACI with access to around 12 petabytes of environmental data stored on its archive, equivalent to around 180,000 64GB smartphones. The data were combined and processed using JASMIN, a data-intensive supercomputer for environmental science.\nBy using both the CEDA Archive and JASMIN\u0026rsquo;s analysis and processing capabilities, BACI scientists and researchers can access and process their own complex data. By accessing these tools remotely, they can cut processing time down from months to days. This has a major impact on the speed these projects become accessible to the public domain and scientific communities for the benefit of all. “At the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis we are continually developing cutting edge data infrastructure, software and processes to rise to the challenge of increasingly large and complex data sets\u0026quot; said Esther Conway. “This not only supports the production and analysis of data sets on projects such as BACI but also ensures the further long term exploitation of such datasets – allowing the data to remain valuable and meet the needs of science long into the future. We are extremely proud to have been able to support projects such as BACI and hope to continue to evolve our data science capabilities to take care of our fragile planet long into the future\u0026quot;.\n​One of the datasets produced from BACI, project \u0026lsquo;System State Vector\u0026rsquo;, has recently been opened to everyone on the CEDA Archive - find it here. The dataset contains Earth observation data that could be easily used and extended for future biodiversity studies and to help policy-makers plan ecosystem loss initiatives more effectively for years to come.\nBACI is funded through the European Union\u0026rsquo;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. It was jointly carried out by: Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Università degli Studi della Tuscia, Eidgenoessische Forschungsanstalt, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Wageningen University, University College London, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Aarhus University, Rezatec Limited and the Science and Technology Facilities Council.\nJASMIN \u0026nbsp; JASMIN is managed jointly by RAL Space\u0026rsquo;s Centre for Environmental Data Analysis and the Scientific Computing Department for STFC on behalf of NERC.

Our staff are involved in a number of exciting projects that have used their roots in space and satellite technology to develop products and services with important applications for life on Earth.​​\nWe are collecting thoughts and opinions on the \u0026lsquo;Bringing space down to Earth\u0026rsquo; campaign.\nPlease fill out this questionnaire here: Bringing space down to Earth ​"

        description: "Leading UK data and computing experts have developed a toolkit and roadmap to get the UK’s digital research infrastructure sector to net zero.",
        
        
        content: "Leading UK data and computing experts have developed a toolkit and roadmap to get the UK’s digital research infrastructure sector to net zero.\nOver the last 2 years, we have led a scoping project that has compiled recommendations for UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to ensure all digital tools used in the sector - from supercomputers like JASMIN to staff laptops - will be sustainable within the next 17 years. The final technical report has now been published and is freely available for anyone to make use of.\nDr Martin Juckes, Head of Atmospheric Science at CEDA, explains: “This scoping project has examined both the energy consumed by the computers in use and the impact of the supply chain. The recommendations we are putting forward will support ambitious environmental sustainability targets, which have been set for the nine organisations that make up UKRI, to be met by 2040 or preferably much sooner.”\nThe scoping project has developed a toolkit, and roadmapped the initial steps required, for the decarbonisation of our national digital research infrastructure. This project was made possible by a £1.9 million investment from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) on behalf of UKRI.\nOver 180 evidence-based recommendations have been synthesised by the scoping project team - involving CEDA, over 90 UK researchers, and more than 20 nationwide research institutes. The recommendations recognise UKRI’s ambition for facilitating state-of-the-art computing tools and techniques, while playing a leading role in navigating the transition to an equitable and sustainable future.\nA new holistic toolkit now sets out the proposals for reaching net zero - supported by a clear roadmap - and intended for people that use, manage, maintain, fund, or make decisions about digital research infrastructure.\nDr Martin Juckes, who was a driving force behind the project, sets out the key findings from the scoping work:\n“The key areas contributing to digital research infrastructure emissions are the purchase of electricity, the manufacture of hardware, the use and the carbon footprint of laptops, and the influence of digital research infrastructure on research and innovation outcomes.\n“The target of achieving net zero emissions by 2040 is extremely challenging, but there is a strong determination to meet that challenge in all areas of the digital research infrastructure and the UK research community that depends on it.\n“A broad set of actions, technical and organisational, need to be implemented across all levels of UKRI to ensure emissions are reduced, and it calls for a community-wide paradigm shift. Individuals and organisations all have a shared responsibility to enact changes.\n“The outcomes of this scoping project were wholly dependent on the immense commitment of staff to tackle a series of challenges and knowledge gaps. This reinforced that people across sectors must work together and learn through action. Peers and suppliers should be sharing examples and best practices, training future experts, and creating new innovative solutions. But, this complex work will require the collective efforts of leaders and staff at all levels of the organisations and sectors involved or affected.\n“The sooner we start implementing changes, however large or small, the sooner we can start our collective journey to net zero. In our report we seek to combine the narrative of the journey, the timeline of the roadmap, and the mechanistic support of the toolkit with the sense of enthusiasm and optimism that so many partners and stakeholders brought to the project.\n“There are uncertainties, there are gaps in our knowledge, and some problems remain to be solved. These are not, nor must they be allowed to be seen as, reasons for inaction. The transition to net zero is vital for action on climate change, and it is clearer than it has ever been that the time to act is now.”\nSix elements of the sustainable computing strategic toolkit \u0026nbsp; The toolkit sets out the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; can be done.\nThe evidence-based recommendations are synthesised into six areas that reflect the challenges likely to be faced as we embark on the net zero journey:\nMission Focus: continuous assessment and focus on the mission of achieving sustainability; active measures to counter the risk of enhanced demand negating efficiency gains. Recognition of shared responsibility: mandate and empower all staff (from student to CEO) to take proportionate action to drive change and reduce the environmental impact of their work; community building; encourage discussion among colleagues and learn from others to foster positive changes in behaviour. Action-based-research: work must start now with commitment appropriate to the climate emergency while recognising that there will be a need for regular checks and adjustments; focus on progress not perfection; small steps; learn from experience. Work with peers and suppliers: through contracts, conditionalities, and understanding mutual benefits, to develop a low carbon supply chain (essential in the longer term). Build and Share Knowledge: providing leadership, support and advice for business cases and large procurements feeding into reporting; central hub for information and institutional knowledge (also likely to create short term results). Green Software Engineering: creating a body of expertise around green software engineering, providing training, developing tools, metrics, expert assessment, and standards to transform current approaches to writing code, and supporting codes running in data centres, such that GSE becomes the norm rather than an optional extra. Three delivery pathways for reaching net zero digital research infrastructure by 2040 \u0026nbsp; Reflecting the actions required and the mechanisms available to effect change, the roadmap describes \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; UKRI can implement the recommendations by 2040 or sooner.\nThe roadmap is organised into three delivery pathways:\nUKRI policy and governance, creating a policy framework which can deliver the steps needed to achieve the net zero ambition. Delivery partnership, in which funders and facility leads or service providers work together to implement the fundamental changes required. Competitive funding, which develops the necessary capabilities and tools drawing on the creativity, diversity and strength in depth of the UK academic community. The scoping project led by CEDA has produced detailed technical analysis, a literature survey, and has compiled results from community and stakeholder engagement and consulting activities. The technical report will be complemented by an overview document - detailing the roadmap and toolkit - that will summarise the key conclusions and recommendations in a more accessible way. The overview document is not yet published, but will be available at the following link when it is ready: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8203117\nPlease contact support@ceda.ac.uk if you have any questions. "

This is useful because converting archived data is impractical on a large scale and duplicating data in multiple formats requires a significant increase to the storage requirements for the archive.\nThis technical blog post would be interesting to anyone looking into cloud accessible analysis ready data. It may also be useful to anyone currently converting or looking to convert data into Zarr format, as Kerchunk provides an alternative with considerable advantages, like reduced computation time and storage requirements. Kerchunk files can also be updated due to changes in NetCDF files more quickly than reconverting to Zarr.\nExperiments with different optimisation methods for kerchunk explored here include representing chunk data formulaically using tools from python libraries and custom syntax extending the usage of these tools to cover less uniform NetCDF file structure.\nFind out more about our work with Kerchunk and our other technical projects here."

We trust that Telespazio UK will be successful in the delivery and operation of the platform for all of our users.\nProfessor John Remedios, Executive Director of the National Centre for Earth Observation, said: “I am delighted with the interest from industry in supporting the EO Data Hub in the UK. Our process has shown the high quality of UK capabilities and the significance of data infrastructure for markets and commercial activity. Telespazio UK will be an excellent partner in the UK’s Data Hub and we welcome them to the project as an expert company with considerable connectivity to the UK and international Earth Observation sectors.”\nDr Geoff Busswell, Head of Marketing \u0026amp; Sales for Telespazio UK, said: “The EO Data Hub is a major step forward for the UK in developing a national capability for the community that can help business and research stakeholders create EO-based market impact. Telespazio UK is excited to bring to bear its deep expertise in hosted data management and big data platform open-source standards in the frame of major Copernicus and ESA programmes. We very much look forward to working with the Core Team to create an interoperable and sustainable EO Data Hub we can be proud of in the UK.”\nPhilip Kershaw, Head of the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis, said: “The award of this contract marks a major milestone in the EO Data Hub, a project which has been funded through NERC as part of DSIT’s EO Investment Package. We look forward to working with our industry partners on the development of the Hub Platform, a core component of the overall system.”\nThis award is the beginning of exciting opportunities within the EODH programme. We have recently launched the Invitation to Tender (ITT) for the EO DataHub Applications and Integrations contract. This ITT’s implementation will mark an important step forward in adding user-orientated service interfaces to the core Hub Platform software. The successful applicants will be expected to work closely with the Platform Development and Operations team for a successful delivery. There are three applications for the ITT which can be applied for as a whole or individually:\nLot 1: Web-application delivering Combined Information from Climate Observations and Projections;\nLot 2: Web-map application showcasing Land Surface data provided through the EODH: responsive and fast “slippy-map” application providing browse, select, compare, visualise and processing capabilities;\nLot 3: Open-source code integrations and training: accelerating use of the Hub Platform capabilities, with a focus on GIS practitioners, through firstly a software integration with an existing platform or software product and secondly a training course delivered through a collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks.\nVisit our website for more information about the EO DataHub Applications and Integrations ITT"

This regular assessment provides policymakers with information on the physical science of climate change. Data from key figures of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) section are now available for anyone to access from the CEDA Archive - with more data expected in the coming months. This is the first time SPM figure data has been available on the same day as report publication. The CEDA team, as part of its role as a member of the IPCC-DDC (Data Distribution Centre), has been working closely with the IPCC WGI Technical Support Unit and the Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments Group (TG-DATA) to ensure data are easily accessible. All data is completely open access. At present, data covers figures from the ‘Summary for Policymakers’ section of the report. Openly sharing data ensures a greater level of reproducibility in science. Key contributors to the figures are individually recognised via publication on the data catalogue pages. Providing individual recognition for contributions to the data enables data creators to receive recognition via citations. The IPCC Secretariat have described CEDA’s work as “an important milestone in the open science dimension of IPCC”. In addition to archiving figure data for the report. CEDA have also contributed through archival of important input climate data, like CMIP6, and by providing analysis capabilities through JASMIN - both proving to be important resources for research feeding into the IPCC assessment report. CEDA helped to improve access to the climate projection data behind the report by undertaking quality control work and developing a data subsetter tool - making complex climate data more accessible for users outside of the core climate community, by making it easier to get at the data they need. The work that CEDA, and partners, do is essential to continue to simplify and improve access to these important datasets. Image: Wildfires in Wales, UK *Image: Forest fires in Wales, UK.\nThe sixth assessment report states: Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).*"

        content: "An inspirational online children’s story titled Grandma’s Footsteps prompts readers to take note of changes in their environment, and to imagine what they want their own future to look like.\nThe fictional story, commissioned by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, was written by award-winning author Patrice Lawrence and illustrated by artist educator Amara Lawrence.\nThe story is set inside the domed city of Etherley and explores why air pollution is changing in different ways and different places, and how it affects people. When the city’s delicate balance is toppled, and patching up the sagging dome isn’t working anymore, protagonist Hy Knowshole follows in their grandma’s footsteps to find out how to restore clean air.\nThrough Hy’s journal entries, readers experience a captivating account of life in Etherley, which unfolds as readers scroll down.\nIllustration taken from the story Image credit: Amara Lawrence / National Centre for Atmospheric Science\nAuthor Patrice Lawrence said:\n“Whether we are adults, children or young people, stories help shape how we see the world around us. As we emerge from difficult times, I hope a funny story can help children feel empowered to improve their local environment.”\nThrough collaboration between creatives, scientists and school children, Grandma’s Footsteps employs the power of storytelling to engage young people with the latest environmental research.\nAir pollution is one of the largest environmental health risks we face today. It not only poses a threat to our environment, but to our health too, causing around 36,000 deaths a year in the UK. Grandma’s Footsteps was inspired by air quality research led by Professor James Lee, which showed that the air became cleaner for a short while during the UK’s first Covid-19 lockdown.\nMassive shifts to low pollution behaviours, like not using our cars, gave us a glimpse of what the future could look like, with clear benefits to us all - especially children who are more vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution. Professor Lee, an atmospheric chemist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of York, said:\n“Air pollution, especially from vehicle exhausts, affects all of us and is a severe risk to our health and wellbeing. During the Covid-19 lockdowns, traffic reduced significantly, leading to a drop in levels of key air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and small particles. Whilst this effect will be short-lived, it has given us a window into a future where exhaust emissions are reduced due to the electrification of the vehicle fleet.”\nTo help the storymakers engage with the perspectives of young readers, the themes and style of Grandma’s Footsteps were developed in collaboration with sixty Year Five pupils at Beckfoot Heaton Primary School in Bradford - a designated clean air zone city. The students submitted hand-drawn illustrations, showing the impacts of air pollution and ways to achieve a world with cleaner air. Zoe Mawson, Headteacher at Beckfoot Heaton Primary School, said:\n“Learning about air pollution and all environmental issues is so important. We need to empower children so that they are able to help shape positive environmental changes. We were delighted to be part of Grandma\u0026rsquo;s Footsteps and proud of our children\u0026rsquo;s ideas and art work.”\nGrandma’s Footsteps is shared online for free, alongside a set of learning resources for Key Stage 2 which offer educators science explainers, suggestions for discussion points, and activities for further learning.\nAmara Lawrence, illustrator and trainee Art Therapist, said:\n“We should never underestimate art’s ability to tell and support stories about social issues that are hard to talk about or explain. For children, art can be an accessible point of entry into discussion about their world. Air pollution is a problem that affects us all so children shouldn’t be left out of the conversation, especially those who are most affected by it. Art is a way of exploring questions which we might not ask otherwise.”\nThe National Centre for Atmospheric Science was awarded a grant by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), as part of UK Research and Innovation’s (UKRI) rapid response call to Covid-19."

        content: "Scientists using the UK’s largest environmental super computer and data store gathered last month to share their experiences of big data environmental science and now you can view their presentations too.\nThe third annual conference provided an opportunity for some of the 1700 existing users of the super data computer, JASMIN, to share their work and learn about the ways in which JASMIN can continue to support their work. All presentations from the conference are available here.\nDr Victoria Bennett, Head of CEDA said,\n\u0026ldquo;Fantastic to see the turnout at our third JASMIN conference, it\u0026rsquo;s been a great opportunity to update our users on latest developments, but also provide a forum for users to network and share ideas, and to find out what we can do to help them get the best out of JASMIN to do their science\u0026rdquo;\nThe huge range of research enabled by JASMIN was reflected in the breadth of presentations at the conference. Talks ranged from high resolution climate modelling to the exploitation of JASMIN architecture for multi mission land surface temperature analysis.\nNew or potential users had the opportunity to learn about what\u0026rsquo;s possible on JASMIN and how it could enhance or enable their research as well as taking part in practical workshops on getting the most out of the platform.\nExisting users learned more about the latest innovations and collaborations including an update on the ongoing upgrade of JASMIN. This is seeing the available storage double to more than 44 Petabytes, equivalent to over 10 billion photos. It will also add around 40% to the processing capability, with 11,500 cores on 600 nodes, similar to adding the power of several thousand high-end laptops. This means that JASMIN users can process and analyse big datasets simultaneously and in very little time.\nJonathan Churchill, JASMIN Systems Architect and Manager for STFC\u0026rsquo;s Scientific Computing Department said:\n\u0026ldquo;We are really excited to welcome researchers in our JASMIN user community to the conference to find out about the fantastic work they have been using JASMIN for and to discuss how we can improve the platform to aid their future research.\u0026rdquo;\nJASMIN is a Natural Environment Research Council Facility (NERC) hosted by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). The event was hosted by CEDA, who jointly manage JASMIN with STFC\u0026rsquo;s Scientific Computing Department.​"

Users will be sent reminder emails to renew their access to our systems, but the following article provides advice to help avoid any issues which may cause common problems accessing JASMIN/CEMS services :\nGo to myCEDA and check that your email address and other details are up to date. This ensures that when we, or automated system messages attempt to contact you, we can be sure that messages will reach you. Your CEDA account only gives you certain privileges by default. As with CEDA archive datasets, most JASMIN services (including access to the login, science analysis servers and transfer machines, and individual Group Workspaces) require additional registration steps which expire after a default period (usually 3 years). You can check the validity period of all your current registrations at myCEDA, and renew in advance to avoid any gaps in access. Typically, you will be emailed 3 months, 14 days and again 7 days before any registration expires, but the onus is on you to renew your registration for each service. If your registration for a \u0026ldquo;login\u0026rdquo; role expires, your SSH key will automatically be revoked from the relevant servers and you will be unable to log in, so login registrations are particularly important to keep up-to-date. Please avoid workflows which involve multiple SSH connections in quick succession (e.g. copying many very small files with individual scp commands). These can appear similar to \u0026ldquo;denial of service\u0026rdquo; attempts and can cause your account to be denied access for periods of time.

This has happened before, in 1997 and again in 1998. We followed our usual procedure, taking several days to be sure we understood exactly what happened. Then yesterday (August 7, 2002), we put the Earth Probe spacecraft back into normal mode and partially turned the TOMS instrument back on. To be sure that we don\u0026rsquo;t get any more contamination after the cold soak TOMS has been through, we plan to wait until Monday (August 12, 2002) to unstow the mirror and resume taking data.

We particularly need to know where the outage may have a critical impact on delivery of your work.\nWe will be preparing a mitigation plan to reduce the impact on critical activities where possible, although our ability to act will be limited, and our primary focus will be on the safe shutdown and restart of the system. Please note, therefore, that for many services there will be little we can do to reduce the impacts. Gathering information means we can report on the anticipated impact, but it does not guarantee that we will be able to change anything. Our plan: \u0026nbsp; The outage means that many CEDA and JASMIN services will be unavailable.\nThe mitigation plan will include: looking at moving our websites to an external server or public cloud identifying and implementing mitigation actions for priority services/projects that will be severely impacted We are also creating a detailed communication plan to ensure we continue to efficiently share information with relevant stakeholders as we receive it. This includes:\nimproving how we report the status of our services. A new status page where all future information will be updated has been created creating a new general mailing list – further details coming soon gather feedback from users about priority projects/services that will be severely impacted What you need to do: \u0026nbsp; Stay up to date by:\ncheck our new status page for updates: https://www.ceda.ac.uk/status/\nfollow us on Twitter: @cedanews\nsigning up to our new mailing list for CEDA users (when available)\nJASMIN users mailing list will be updated as appropriate\nSpread the word:\nTell your colleagues to be aware of this and how they can stay up to date Be kind and considerate to our staff:\nRemember that we are a small team running many diverse and complex services. We will be doing our best in a difficult situation. We know this is not an ideal situation. However, it is part of the risk associated with using a research infrastructure.

We were informed on Friday, July 20, 2001, that a final decision to shut off UARS instrument operations on September 30, 2001, has been made at NASA Headquarters. Given the positive response that we received at our May meeting with Jack Kaye, Ghassem Assarar, and Mike Luther, we thought that UARS measurements would continue for at least part of FY02. We were encouraged to develop a minimum cost plan for operations through December 31, 2002, and this had been our principle activity up until Friday. We were totally surprized and extremely disappointed by this decision and we don\u0026#39;t know if anything can be done to reverse this decision. No final decision has yet been made concerning the disposition of the UARS and it is still possible that a retrieval will occur. Also, there has yet been no final decision concerning the final archiving of the UARS data. It is possible that this message is not reaching everyone with interests in the UARS.

        content: "Measurements of historical weather variables across the UK are now freely available to all, through the Met Office “MIDAS Open” dataset held at CEDA. This new dataset is an open data version of the popular Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS) for land surface station data (1853-2017). MIDAS Open contains UK weather observations for the UK that can now be accessed by everyone, rather than restricted to academic use as in the full MIDAS dataset. We anticipate this to be particularly useful for researchers, service providers or members of the public who have previously been unable to use MIDAS data.\nThe key differences for MIDAS Open, compared to the fuller MIDAS dataset, include:\nIt is limited to UK land, surface site data only (no global sites, upper air or marine observations). Currently this represents approximately 95% of available daily temperature and weather observations, 83% of hourly weather data, and 13% of daily rainfall within the full MIDAS collection. The collection include surface site data from stations owned, operated or run by Met Office as part of the public weather service. The wider MIDAS provision include sites operated by or on behalf of others, but these will still be available for research-only use through the full MIDAS. The data are formatted in BADC-CSV making them more user friendly. The directory structure makes it easier to find specific variables, sites and time periods. Each year a versioned release will update with the latest data (e.g. 2018 data will be available in summer 2019) and additionally include late arriving data or new data that is added in for old time periods (e.g. new data for 1950s has been added in recently). It’s open access, but you will still need to register as a CEDA user (anyone can do this in a couple of simple steps). This is so we can gather more useful download statistics for the data. MIDAS Open comprises of hourly and daily weather measurements and observations of parameters relating to temperature, rainfall, sunshine, radiation, wind and weather observations such as present weather codes, cloud cover, snow etc.\nThe MIDAS data are currently used by a wide range of academic users. One example is for solar panel (photovoltaic) research undertaken by Dr Diane Palmer from Loughborough University. Diane uses ground measurements of global horizontal irradiation data from weather stations in the MIDAS data. “Without the ground measurements held at CEDA, I would need to use satellite data and conduct very different research. The archive allows me to easily access the data I need” said Diane. She uses these data to produce national solar profile maps to study the impact of solar panel generation on the National Grid. Her research also helps identify suitable locations for solar farms and rooftop systems. Installation of renewable energy resources, such as solar panels, helps to combat greenhouse emissions and reduce fossil fuel dependence - ultimately helping to tackle climate change. Diane’s research, which relied on MIDAS data held at CEDA, has been used by the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to inform government policy. The list of Diane’s publications produced using MIDAS data are below for further reference.\nThe new open access MIDAS dataset will allow further applications and uses of the data - by many users who could not previously access the data under the restricted licenses. If you already use MIDAS data for your research, or you are planning to use the new MIDAS Open data, we’d love to hear from you about how you use it and for what. Please fill in our form here, it will take less than 10 minutes and help us to gather evidence of the impact CEDA services have on researchers and wider society.\nImage: Met Office weather station site in the UK. Diane Palmer, Ian Cole, Tom Betts, Ralph Gottschalg, 2017, Interpolating and estimating horizontal diffuse solar irradiation to provide UK-wide coverage: selection of the best performing models, Energies, Special Issue “Solar Photovoltaics Trilemma: Efficiency, Stability and Cost Reduction 2017”, 10, 181; doi:10.3390/en10020181, URL: http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/2/181\nDiane Palmer, Elena Koubli, Ian Cole, Tom Betts, Ralph Gottschalg.

        content: "Initial Project Aim \u0026nbsp; Our initial aim was to provide a clear roadmap to deliver carbon neutral digital research infrastructure (DRI) by 2040 or earlier. This covers the entire DRI estate for UK Research and Innovation. the core project team at CEDA was to lead an initial, 18-month UKRI-wide study to survey the digital carbon landscape, run a set of demonstrators and develop a roadmap to ensure that our data infrastructure can achieve net zero. Taking a systems-based approach, CEDA would work to develop adaptation strategies for the way data is conserved, analysed and managed.\nThe link to the project website is here\nResults Over the last 2 years, we have led a scoping project that has compiled recommendations for UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to ensure all digital tools used in the sector - from supercomputers like JASMIN to staff laptops - will be sustainable within the next 17 years. The final technical report has now been published and is freely available for anyone to make use of\u0026nbsp; The scoping project has developed a toolkit, and roadmapped the initial steps required, for the decarbonisation of our national digital research infrastructure. This project was made possible by a £1.9 million investment from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) on behalf of UKRI. Over 180 evidence-based recommendations have been synthesised by the scoping project team - involving CEDA, over 90 UK researchers, and more than 20 nationwide research institutes. The recommendations recognise UKRI’s ambition for facilitating state-of-the-art computing tools and techniques, while playing a leading role in navigating the transition to an equitable and sustainable future. A new holistic toolkit now sets out the proposals for reaching net zero - supported by a clear roadmap - and intended for people that use, manage, maintain, fund, or make decisions about digital research infrastructure. Six elements of the sustainable computing strategic toolkit The toolkit sets out the \"what\" can be done. The evidence-based recommendations are synthesised into six areas that reflect the challenges likely to be faced as we embark on the net zero journey: \u0026nbsp; Mission Focus\nContinuous assessment and focus on the mission of achieving sustainability; active measures to counter the risk of enhanced demand negating efficiency gains. \u0026nbsp; Build and Share Knowledge\nProviding leadership, support and advice for business cases and large procurements feeding into reporting; central hub for information and institutional knowledge. \u0026nbsp; Action-based-research\nWork must start now with commitment appropriate to the climate emergency while recognising that there will be a need for regular checks and adjustments; focus on progress not perfection; small steps; learn from experience. \u0026nbsp; Work with peers and suppliers\nThrough contracts, conditionalities, and understanding mutual benefits, to develop a low carbon supply chain (essential in the longer term). \u0026nbsp; Recognition of shared responsibility\nmandate and empower all staff to take proportionate action to drive change and reduce the environmental impact of their work; community building; encourage discussion among colleagues and learn from others to foster positive changes in behaviour. \u0026nbsp; Green Software Engineering\nCreating a body of expertise around green software engineering, providing training, developing tools, and standards to transform current approaches to writing code, and supporting codes running in data centres, such that GSE becomes the norm rather than an optional extra. Three delivery pathways for reaching net zero digital research infrastructure by 2040 Reflecting the actions required and the mechanisms available to effect change, the roadmap describes \"how\" UKRI can implement the recommendations by 2040 or sooner. UKRI policy and governance\nCreating a policy framework which can deliver the steps needed to achieve the net zero ambition. Delivery partnership\nFunders and facility leads or service providers work together to implement the fundamental changes required. Competitive funding\nDeveloping the necessary capabilities and tools drawing on the creativity, diversity and strength in depth of the UK academic community."

UnEarthed was a showcase of the diverse environmental science undertaken by NERC scientists, ranging from decaying Puffins, making clouds in a bottle, to virtual reality floods. The event was free to attend at Dynamic Earth, in Edinburgh, and nearly ~7000 people visited over 4 days.\nir camera demo Poppy Townsend organised the ‘Our changing planet seen from space’ stand with colleagues at NCEO (National Centre of Earth Observation). Activities included the Infra-red camera, Sentinel 3 satellite model, visualisations for how big Sentinel data is, and a pledge wall.\nPoppy explains, ‘The main narrative was that we use similar thermal cameras on satellites in space to measure temperature - and therefore climate change (whilst demonstrating all the usual fun IR activities - like drawing beards with ice, or wearing safety goggles).\nThe next section linked to the Sentinel satellites and how they produce huge amounts of data; ~10TB is archived at CEDA every day… and just like when we take too many photos on our phones, we run out of space for satellite data too. This was represented by grains of rice and comparison to animal weights.\n(2 grains of rice = average smartphone; 625 grains = 10TB daily Sentinel data; ~125,000 grains = 2PB of total archived Sentinel data)\nAs the nature of the science discussed climate change, we thought it would be a nice way to suggest small easy changes (or pledges) that individual’s could make. The idea being that climate change is a huge issue and sometimes it’s hard to know how to reduce your impact on the planet. Examples included; using less single-use plastic, going vegetarian one day a week, and only filling the kettle with the water you need. Approximately 180 pledges were recorded on our poster wall and visitors even suggested new pledges of their own.’\nPledges and sea surface temperature floor puzzle The event was a huge success and had very positive feedback - some examples include;\n‘It was amazing. I would go again and again and again’\n‘I want to be a scientist when I’m older’\n‘SCIENCE IS AWESOME’\nIf you’d like to see more photos from the event then search for #UnEarthed2017 on Twitter.

Please register to attend and/or share widely with your networks! Further events will be announced in due course.\nBest wishes, The UKRI Net Zero DRI project team.\nProject partners webinars \u0026nbsp; We are holding two webinars to share the outcomes of work undertaken by our project partners. These pieces of work have been undertaken by over 40 researchers from 20 different institutions over the last ~6 months.Both webinars are intended to provide an opportunity for the wider research community to engage with and discuss the project outcomes.The webinars have been divided according to two themes reflected in the findings and recommendations of the projects: * Webinar 1 - Technical and Operational Challenges - Tuesday 31 January 2-4pm (UK time)\nWebinar 2 - Community and Organisational Challenges - Thursday 2 February, 1:30-3:30pm (UK time) Please register to attend here.\nCreative workshops \u0026nbsp; We have commissioned artist Paul Millhouse-Smith to deliver a large-scale art-work in response to the core ambitions - and challenges - associated with the net zero agenda. The final piece will inspire collective action and stimulate conversations surrounding the transition to net zero digital research infrastructure (DRI).As part of this commission, Paul is facilitating four creative workshops in January and February to gather information that will inspire his final artwork and facilitate discussion.Decarbonising the digital research infrastructure will require a reassessment of existing habits, values and methodologies across the research community. These workshops are therefore open to anyone working with DRI, including researchers within any and all disciplines and career stages.The workshops offer an opportunity to engage critically and creatively with the environmental sustainability discussion.The online creative workshops will be held on the following dates, you only need to attend one:* Friday 27 January 1-4pm\nMonday 30 January 1-4pm Friday 3 February 10am-1pm Tuesday 7 February 10am-1pm There is also an option to participate offline For further information and to register your interest."

Thankfully, our services have run largely as normal throughout the pandemic, but 10 months on, unfortunately, this ‘at risk’ status still stands. See below for details about how we anticipate it will continue to affect us and you.\nServices at risk due to small team \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; The JASMIN/CEDA team is a small team with many services supported by a limited number of individuals with key expertise. The team has been successfully working remotely since March and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. However, it has not been an easy situation for everyone. With all schools now closed again, some staff will need to work reduced hours. This applies to staff within CEDA and STFC’s Scientific Computing Department (SCD), but also those in other areas of STFC which provide core services such as network and power.\nDelays to user support and resolving issues \u0026nbsp; 2020 was our busiest year for user support to date - we helped over 1750 users via the helpdesk. The helpdesk team have worked hard to keep users informed and we managed to send an initial response to over 93% of queries within one working day. Whilst we have managed to keep our response times prompt, some issues raised have taken longer than normal to resolve. This can be due to a variety of reasons related to the current situation: whether it’s making issues harder to diagnose, or whether known issues, planned to be addressed by strategic improvements, can’t yet be fixed. Changes to the situation over the past few months, in particular the restrictions around work in our machine room, have made planning and implementing these improvements much more difficult, not to mention disruption to supply chains and logistics.\nGiven the tighter restrictions announced by the UK Government yesterday, we anticipate these impacts to continue for some time.\nSummary: \u0026nbsp; Overall, our services have run largely as normal throughout the pandemic. However, when issues have occurred, it has taken the team longer than normal to resolve them. We anticipate that this will continue until Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. Therefore, our services should still be considered ‘at risk’ for the foreseeable future. We would ask you to continue to be patient and courteous to our support staff when reporting issues and waiting for them to be resolved. As ever, we will continue to do our best!\nWatch this space for further information about online events such as user seminars, training and webinars which we’ll be running throughout the year: we look forward to “seeing” you!\nWith best wishes for a happier and healthier 2021,\nCEDA/JASMIN team"

We will resume the upgrade on Tuesday 23 April.\nCurrently, guest VMs are fully functional. When the upgrade is resumed on 23 April there will be some intermittent connectivity issues, but the VMs themselves should be unaffected.\nWhile the JASMIN Cloud Portal and OpenStack API are functional, we have decided to keep them in maintenance mode until the upgrade is complete, and we are again confident that the JASMIN Cloud is ready for public use.\nWe apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your patience during this important maintenance.\nMany thanks,\nThe JASMIN Team"

This issue is still under investigation and is likely to be addressed by a software update. For now, the recommended workaround for users is to move to a different machine if possible. Issue 2: This appeared as file systems appearing to hang/freeze and becoming unavailable. We believe this issue has now been resolved, but please report any further instances to support@jasmin.ac.uk. 2) New disk storage capacity\nSome of the new disk storage purchased at the end of last year is now delivered and being installed. It is hoped that the first of this new capacity will be made available to consortium managers towards the end of May, which will hopefully ease the current pressure on storage capacity across the system. A further update about other benefits brought by the Phase 7 upgrade will follow in due course.\n3) Update on Elastic Tape Service\nSince earlier this year, the Elastic Tape service has been out of action to users. The issue centered around the system’s view of a disk cache used for retrievals, which was causing operations to fail unexpectedly. The teams involved have been working very hard to understand and resolve this, and have now made good progress. Testing has been underway since last week and it is hoped that further trials with some invited users will lead to a return to operations very shortly. Please look out for further announcements and accept our sincere apologies for the unavailability of this service for what we appreciate has been a significant time.\n4) Update on network connectivity\nWork completed last week on the RAL site firewall caused some additional disruption beyond the scheduled date but should now be resolved.\nWe apologise for any inconvenience caused by these issues. Please note that JASMIN support will be unavailable for the UK bank holiday long weekend - normal support will resume on Tuesday 4th May.\nJASMIN Team"

However, the use of this new class of storage allowed us to meet the ever growing needs of the community within the available funding. If we had stayed using the old storage we would only be able to provide 1/3 of the current capacity. We need to work together as a community to change our workflows to suit the new storage capabilities.\nPlease remind yourself of the different types of storage and how best to work with them. The following documents may be useful starting points:\nUnderstanding new JASMIN storage - explains the different storage types and why we chose them\nFAQs - these give specific examples of known issues where parallel writes have occurred (maybe unknowingly to you).\nIf you experience difficulties again, please refer to this document for information about how to contact the Helpdesk.

        description: "A major upgrade is being made to double the storage available on JASMIN; a globally unique data intensive supercomputer for environmental science.",
        
        
        content: "A major upgrade is being made to double the storage available on JASMIN; a globally unique data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. The upgraded system will support the global analysis of the next generation of climate models and provide a venue for UK academia and industry to exploit Earth observation data.\nJASMIN provides the UK and European climate and earth-system science communities with the ability to access very large sets of environmental data, which are typically too big for them to download to their own computers, and process it rapidly, reducing the time it takes to test new ideas and get results; from months or weeks to days or hours. The upgrade will double the available storage to more than 44 Petabytes, equivalent to over 10 billion photos. It will also add around 40% to the processing capability, with 11,500 cores on 600 nodes, similar to adding the power of several thousand high-end laptops. This means that the 1700 registered users of JASMIN can process and analyse big datasets simultaneously and in very little time.\nImage of the machine room where JASMIN is situated at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Figure 1: The machine room where JASMIN is situated at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)\nJASMIN currently supports over 160 science projects, JASMIN users research topics ranging from earthquake detection and oceanography to air pollution and climate science. When JASMIN was brought online 6 years ago with just 4.5 Petabytes of storage it revolutionised access to data for the environmental science community in the UK. This latest upgrade offers a huge leap in the capability of the system for users.\nDr Victoria Bennett, Head of CEDA, said “We are excited to be expanding JASMIN to manage the increasingly large datasets, from satellites, climate models and other sources. For example the current Sentinel Earth observation satellites alone are producing 10 Terabytes of data every day and this will grow as more are launched as part of the European Commission\u0026rsquo;s Copernicus programme. This upgrade will allow us to build on the successes we\u0026rsquo;ve already seen in enabling our users in the science community to efficiently process and analyse these massive datasets.”\nFunded with a multi-million pound investment from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), the upgraded system will also continue to provide the “UK environmental data commons” - an online collaborative space bringing together data, services and expertise - underpinning much of academic environmental science. NERC Associate Director for National Capability and Capital, Dr Liz Fellman, said, \u0026ldquo;The JASMIN supercomputer is central to delivering NERC science across its portfolio and provides a globally unique and increasingly powerful capability for the UK\u0026rsquo;s environmental science community, enabling significant improvement of predictive environmental science to benefit the UK and beyond. NERC welcomes this major upgrade to a world-class facility.\u0026rdquo;\nProfessor Pier Luigi Vidale from the University of Reading has been using JASMIN since 2012 to store and analyse high-resolution global climate model data and said of the upgrade “The project we’re currently leading involves 21 institutions across Europe and will output more than 4 Petabytes of data. The JASMIN upgrade will allow us to store all data and to do most of the analysis online, thus dramatically speeding up the extraction of science, at unprecedented resolution and enabling scientific publication at a far higher rate. We would not have embarked on the project without the enhanced JASMIN.”\nAs a “customised” data intensive supercomputer, the JASMIN upgrade involves the integration of computing equipment from many suppliers, a specialised new network, the development and deployment of new software, and the migration of Petabytes of archived data from old hardware, in need of retirement, to new. The entire process will take many months, from the integration of the first new equipment in March until the last of the old storage is retired. Completion is expected by the end of 2018. The system integration is being led by STFC Scientific Computing Department (SCD), and the software and data management by CEDA. Jonathan Churchill, JASMIN Systems Architect and Manager for SCD, is part of the team that has designed and are now installing the upgrade that will be exploited by the ever expanding JASMIN science communities. He said “Not only have we dramatically scaled out JASMIN storage, compute and networking, but the new storage and networking technologies will improve the user ‘experience’ and provide capabilities that we have never been able to make available to users before. The compute upgrade will provide not only much needed extra batch computing cores but also provide the deep, on-demand cloud computing capacity and flexibility that releases new analysis environments to our science communities.”\nJASMIN is jointly managed on behalf of NERC by CEDA, part of RAL Space, and SCD all based within STFC at Harwell campus in Oxfordshire.\nContact:\nMadeleine Russell, Communications Officer, RAL Space\nTel: +44 (0) 1235446288\nMob: +44 (0) 7594083386\nEmail: madeleine.russell@stfc.ac.uk\nJake Gilmore, Media Manager, STFC\nTel: +44 (0) 1793442092 Mob: +44 (0) 7970994586\nEmail: jake.gilmore@stfc.ac.uk"

We apologise for the very short notice but are passing on the information to you now that we have been made aware of the potential impact.\nThis essential work is being performed by the RAL core networking team and specialist contractors and unfortunately cannot be postponed or rescheduled.\nThere are two possible outcomes for the work at 17:00, it is hoped that we will only see a 5 minute outage at 17:00, followed by some minor, short lived interruptions approximately 15 minutes later. The less hopeful scenario could result in the network being unavailable for 30+ minutes whilst the original firewall is restored from backup.\nThank you for your patience \u0026amp; understanding. "

        title: "Using JASMIN for the largest ever UK wildlife assessment",
        description: "Most of the UK’s wildlife is in decline, according to the 2019 State of Nature (SoN) report. However getting to this statement was not an easy process.",
        
        
        content: "Most of the UK’s wildlife is in decline, according to the 2019 State of Nature (SoN) report. However getting to this statement was not an easy process. Imagine trying to measure trends across thousands of different species and millions of datapoints, with biases in the data thrown in for added complexity… but that’s exactly what scientists have now done. The most comprehensive SoN report has now been completed with the help of JASMIN - our globally unique petascale analysis facility for data-intensive environmental science. Researchers relying on JASMIN for their data analysis contributed information to the SoN report, including several wildlife groups that had previously been impossible to analyse.\nResearchers from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) used JASMIN’s large scale processing capability to contribute to the groundbreaking wildlife assessment. “I use observation data for our work, which is when volunteers go out and record what wildlife they’ve seen and where. This can be used to get a picture of how biodiversity has changed, in this case, from 1970 to 2015” explained Dr Charlie Outhwaite, a Research Associate at University College London and CEH. Unfortunately, as these data are collected in an unstandardised way it can lead to biases in the datasets. Therefore, to analyse these data, complex models must be used - which is where JASMIN steps in. To account for some of these biases the researcher used occupancy models - these are hierarchical models that allow the separation of the data collection process and the ecological processes enabling the accounting of certain data biases. “When there are a lot of data, these models take a long time to run. We wanted to analyse 12,000 species using over 34,000,000 records - so using a home computer, or even CEH’s small computing cluster, was simply not feasible for all datasets” explains Dr Outhwaite. Even with JASMIN’s fast parallel processing it still took months to complete some of the model runs, but without JASMIN, the scale of this research would not have been possible at all. At a national scale, the trends of less well-studied taxonomic groups (such as ants, mayflies and spiders) over time was not previously known. This was due to the limited availability of records and subsequent biases in the data. The use of occupancy modelling has now allowed us to explore these groups. Groups, including bryophytes, lichens and moths, had not been included in the State of Nature reports previously due to the challenge of analysing the huge datasets. JASMIN’s processing power means it is now possible to analyse these groups and for this research to contribute to a clearer and more detailed picture of change in less well-studied wildlife groups. However, there are still gaps in the available data for many of the UK’s less common species, even in well surveyed groups such as birds. One example is the Pied Flycatcher which is threatened in the UK (see image). Additional research is now being undertaken on JASMIN to more precisely estimate trends for less common bird species. Dr Philipp Boersch-Supan, an Ecological Statistician at the British Trust for Ornithology, explains “This research heavily relies on the computing and storage capabilities of JASMIN - which enable us to do new types of analyses that had previously been impossible to conduct on our in-house hardware. We also relied on the ability to easily access climate data from the CEDA Archive to feed into our analyses”. Image credit: Pied Flycatcher, by Edmund Fellowes / BTO.\nJASMIN enabled research that contributed to the largest study of UK wildlife to date and continues to be essential for future research. Studying wildlife trends can help us to gain a better understanding of how and why species populations change by considering man-made and environmental drivers. As well as the State of Nature report, this research also contributes to the annual UK Biodiversity Indicators report, which is an obligation for the UK government to monitor progress towards biodiversity targets (like the Aichi targets). This work helps guide government policy on environmental issues such as pollinator declines and impacts of climate change on wildlife. Without JASMIN, it is unlikely that so many species could have been analysed. The outputs of the occupancy models produced by this research can be downloaded from the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre here. Research papers are currently in preparation, and will be added into this article when available.\nContact:\nTo find out more about this research, contact: Dr Charlie Outhwaite, Postdoctoral Research Associate, Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London - https://charlieouthwaite.weebly.com/ For more information about using JASMIN, please contact our helpdesk: support@ceda.ac.uk Footnotes:\nJASMIN is managed jointly by STFC\u0026rsquo;s Scientific Computing Department and CEDA (Centre for Environmental Data Analysis), part of RAL Space.

Resources used in the workshops can be found here.\nThis hands-on workshop is aimed at novice to intermediate users of\u0026nbsp;JASMIN\u0026nbsp;who wish to further their knowledge about efficiently working on JASMIN.\u0026nbsp;We will cover a range of topics related to best practice for working on JASMIN. The workshop format will be via hands-on exercises and short presentations. Some example exercises include:\nCopying data to JASMIN\nBatch running scripts on LOTUS\nBuilding your own Python 3 environment\nOptimising storage usage on JASMIN\nManaging a multi-step workflow\nWe hope that this hands-on, attendee driven workshop format will encourage interaction and collaboration between attendees and the JASMIN team. You can see the material from our last workshop\u0026nbsp;here. We will largely cover the same topics but note it may change slightly.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nThe one day workshop will take place\u0026nbsp;in a classroom\u0026nbsp;in Oxfordshire at CEDA's home institute - STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. We intend to cover the general exercises between 9.30-4pm, we will then cover some more advanced specialist topics between 4-6pm (e.g. Build your own Python3 environment, Compile and run parallel Fortran code on LOTUS). It is your choice whether you stay until 4pm or 6pm depending on your training requirements.\u0026nbsp;\nThe workshop will be delivered and supported by the JASMIN team (from both\u0026nbsp;CEDA\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;SCD), so is a great chance to interact, to discuss your research needs, and to provide feedback on the JASMIN service.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nOverall aims of the workshop:\u0026nbsp; To engage novice to intermediate users in best practice for working on JASMIN via hands-on exercises\nTo increase understanding about:\nwhich parts of JASMIN are suited for different tasks\navailable software on JASMIN\nTo provide a face-to-face environment where the JASMIN Team can offer support and feedback on a range of issues/problems\nTo gather feedback on the gaps in current provision of documentation"
