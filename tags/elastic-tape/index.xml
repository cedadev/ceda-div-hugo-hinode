&lt;p>As many users of the tape systems will know, we have recently experienced problems with the NLA, ET and JDMA services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Update on JASMIN tape services and related issues</title><link>https://www.ceda.ac.uk/news/updates/2023/2023-05-11-update-on-jasmin-tape-services-and-related-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 11:29:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ceda.ac.uk/news/updates/2023/2023-05-11-update-on-jasmin-tape-services-and-related-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p>Please note the further updates below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Although initially thought to be only a problem with ET/JDMA service itself, the current issues with slow throughput are now thought to be mainly due to a problem with the PFS storage from where the particular tape jobs are being ingested.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The issue with PFS storage is also affecting other volumes in that system, including XFC volumes &lt;code>/work/xfc/*&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>/work/scratch-pw*&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/gws/pw/j07/*&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These issues are being actively pursued with the storage vendor and the urgency has been escalated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Further interventions to restore stability to the tape services are possible in due course.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We apologise for the disruption caused by these issues, but are working to understand and resolve them as soon as possible.JASMIN Team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Near-line archive is now available.
