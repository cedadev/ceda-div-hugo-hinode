At the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis we support lots of different environmental research. As part of this, it’s important to share what we do and the impact that the science we support has on our planet.

This page includes some activities that we have designed for public engagement events. If you wish to reuse this content, please credit this webpage.

## Warming Stripes

{{< image src="img/outreach/harwell-warming-stripes.png" caption="Warming stripes showing temperature change in Harwell, Oxfordshire" >}}

The warming stripes are a simple visual way to represent our planet’s changing climate - with each stripe representing the temperature of a single year.

You can freely access all the data, tools and knowledge you need to produce your personalised climate stripe for a location within the UK - whether that’s for your hometown, workplace or favourite holiday destination.

Talking about our changing climate is one of the most powerful ways we can encourage positive change. We have made a tool that allows you to make a personalised warming stripes with your chosen location and timespan - to inspire conversations about climate change.

You could use this data to create a craft project - whether that's with crochet, paint, embroidery, mosaic, cake baking or any other technique it is up to you.

### Resources to support this activity

#### Don't know if you can make a difference?

Climate change can feel so huge and overwhelming that you may think local action isn’t enough to make a difference. But there are lots that individuals and communities can do.

Simply talking and sharing ideas about local issues and solutions can have an impact. It can help you to feel more in control.

Taking action with your neighbours, friends or family helps build community and strengthen local pride. It can also deliver a host of health and wellbeing benefits… whilst of course having a positive impact on your local environment.

#### Worried about climate change?

Climate anxiety or eco-anxiety is a way of describing how some people feel about the future in relation to our changing planet. Lots of people feel worried about the future and how things might change. It can sometimes be hard to know what to do with those feelings.

You are not alone - when asked about climate change, three-quarters of young people said the future of the world was frightening - and even scientists feel these feelings.

Here are some tips:

- Learn more about what’s happening - this can help you feel more confident in talking about your fears
- Share how you’re feeling - find a likeminded community who understand
- Reduce your carbon footprint - do something, even if it’s small
- Get involved - talk, raise awareness, encourage others to make changes
- Take care of yourself - you will have good and bad days
