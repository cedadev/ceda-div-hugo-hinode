The CEDA Archive is the national data centre for atmospheric and earth observation and forms part of NERC's Environmental Data Service - a network of data centres covering all aspects of environmental science. Our team coordinate data management on behalf of NERC for the UK atmospheric science and earth observation communities. 

We hold data covering climate, composition, observations and numerical weather prediction as well as various earth observation datasets, including airborne and satellite data and imagery. Our main goal is to ensure that atmospheric and earth observation data are made available and accessible to all in order to fully realise their reuse potential.
