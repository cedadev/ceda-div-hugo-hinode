### Key Services 

__The CEDA Archive__

The {{< link "https://archive.ceda.ac.uk/" >}} CEDA Archive {{< /link >}}  is the national data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. We host over 20 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data. Sources include aircraft campaigns, satellites, automatic weather stations and climate models, amongst many more. 

The CEDA Archive forms part of {{< link "https://eds.ukri.org/environmental-data-service" >}} NERC's Environmental Data Service {{< /link >}}  - a network of data centres covering all aspects of environmental science. Our team coordinate data management on behalf of {{< link "https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/" >}} NERC {{< /link >}}  for the UK atmospheric science and earth observation communities. 

We hold data covering climate, composition, observations and numerical weather prediction as well as various earth observation datasets, including airborne and satellite data and imagery. Our main goal is to ensure that atmospheric and earth observation data are made available and accessible to all in order to fully realise their reuse potential.

Prior to November 2016, these functions were operated by CEDA under the titles of the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) and the NERC Earth Observation Data Centre (NEODC).


__JASMIN__

JASMIN is a globally unique data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. Over 160 science projects are currently supported, covering topics ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation and analysis of wildlife populations.

JASMIN supports the data analysis requirements of the UK and European climate and earth system modelling community. It consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage co-located with data analysis computing facilities, with dedicated light paths to various key facilities and institutes within the community.
