## JASMIN
JASMIN is a globally unique data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. JASMIN supports the data analysis requirements of the UK and European climate and earth system modelling community. It consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage co-located with data analysis computing facilities, with dedicated light paths to various key facilities and institutes within the community.

Our services are provided on behalf of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) and the National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO). CEDA is based within the RAL Space department of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). JASMIN is co-managed by CEDA and STFC's Scientific Computing Department.
