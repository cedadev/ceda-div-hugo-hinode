The Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) has evolved over time as its remit has changed and developed in response to the needs of its user community. The following gives a brief history of this evolution and a timeline of significant changes.

The original "CEDA" group followed the merger of two of NERC's data centres  - the BADC and NEODC - in 2005, originally being called the Centre for Environmental Data Archival. However, with greater support for users analysing the data too a slight name change from the A in CEDA from Archival to Analysis occurred in 2015 to reflect this growing and important role for CEDA.

Prior to 2005 CEDA's history was that as the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC), with "CEDA"'s 20th anniversary being celebrated in 2015.  Sam Pepler also put together {{< link "http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/IDCC15/Presentations%20Day%202/C3/idcc15-20yearsBADC_v2.0C3.pdf" >}}a presentation about CEDA's evolution {{< /link >}} during this time which was presented at the 10th International Digital Data Curation conference in 2015.

The BADC was established in 1994 when it superseded a previous facility: the Geophysical Data Facility (GDF). The GDF was previously funded by the then Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) and primarily supported what was then called the "upper atmosphere" remote sensing community (based as it was on studies of the atmosphere between 10 and 400km). However a survey of the NERC community (Carruthers and Thornes, 1995: Development of the Atmospheric Science and Technology Implementation Plan), resulted in an increased remit for the newly renamed BADC to support the entire NERC atmospheric science community. Over the last decade, it has become apparent that the BADC provides services to a wider community than just the atmospheric sciences community (e.g. medicine, biology, waste management, marine sciences, ecology, etc...)
