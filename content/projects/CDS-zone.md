Aim: The UK Climate Data from Space zone (CDS zone) is a dedicated computing area comprising 400TB storage and 200 processing cores on the JASMIN infrastructure. A suite of software tools will be developed that operate across ECV processing chains and allow users and data producers to view, show and interact with the system status - ECV Data Viewer and ECV Processor Dashboard (allowing engineers, data producers and users to visually check on processor and data output status)
