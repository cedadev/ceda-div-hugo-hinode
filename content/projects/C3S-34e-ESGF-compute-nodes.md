Summary: Improvement on the WPS link for C3S to access climate simulations.

Aim: This project worked to build on the current WPS (Web Processing Service) framework in use by C3S to access global and regional climate simulations, which are curated and served by the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). C3S_34e added data-reduction capability whilst establishing a reliable and robust WPS service with an initial focus on subsetting, averaging and regridding.

CEDA role: Managed the overall administration and execution of the contract, technical management and coordination, liaison with partners and CDS Team, technical guidance on overall design and direction, coordination of additional WPS processes and input into overall design and main developer of overall WPS solution.
