We are pleased to announce that you may now apply for access to the Met Office MASS data archive from the BADC/JASMIN compute facility.


Information about the service, and how to apply for access is provided on the External Access to MASS webpage at:


[http://collab.metoffice.gov.uk/twiki/bin/view/Support/ExternalAccessToMASS](http://collab.metoffice.gov.uk/twiki/bin/view/Support/ExternalAccessToMASS "Link to further details about the MASS archive access") 


MASS is the Met Office Managed Archive Storage System and is accessed using the user interface known as MOOSE (roughly the Met Office Operational Storage Environment), access is now possible from both MONSooN and the JASMIN system at BADC. JASMIN users will need to be working on existing collaboration projects with Met Office Scientists, and will need a Senior Met Office Scientist to act as a “sponsor", who will be able to organise an account for you. MONSooN users are automatically set up with an account for accessing MASS, but will need to register for additional access from JASMIN.


If you would like further information, or are interested in registering for use of the service, please contact the [Met Office Collaboration Service Manager](mailto:monsoon@metoffice.gov.uk "Email the Met Office Collaboration Service Manager") for further details.
