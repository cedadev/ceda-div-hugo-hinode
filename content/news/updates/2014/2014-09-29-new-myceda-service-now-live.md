Last week saw the roll out of the new myCEDA service - replacing the old myBADC and myNEODC services.


The new myCEDA service allows users to register, apply for access to restricted datasets and keep their CEDA account up to date.


Already registered with BADC or NEODC?
--------------------------------------


There is no need to re-register as BADC and NEODC accounts have been using the same system for a number of years and users should continue to use their accounts as before. The new myCEDA interface is an improved service to support the provision of these accounts within CEDA  - the group that runs the BADC and NEODC data centres.


Dataset index and Dataset registration
--------------------------------------


These too are now handled withing our new services.ceda.ac.uk site, though users should be familiar with the stages needed to apply for datasets.  The old dataset index has now been replaced with one that brings together the NEODC and BADC indexes in one searchable interface.


Need assistance?
----------------


If you encounter any problems using the new system please [contact the CEDA helpdesk](/contact "Contact the CEDA helpdesk") and we will be happy to assist.
