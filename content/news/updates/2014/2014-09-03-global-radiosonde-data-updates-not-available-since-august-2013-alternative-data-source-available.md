Due to issues acquiring the Met Office Global Radiosonde data from the Met Office archive, the Global Radiosonde archive at CEDA-BADC has not been updated since August 2013. Sadly, there has not been sufficient resources available to resolve this. We are however hoping that we might see some progress in due course.


In the meanwhile, CEDA-BADC also get TEMP and PILOT messages through another channel from the Met Office via the [MetDB dataset](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/badc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__dataent_12416267981127416).


Unfortunately, though, these messages are broken up in to their 4 parts and so would need to be "stitched" together to form the full profile seen in the global radiosonde directory. These data are available in the ["raw" folder](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/browse/badc/ukmo-metdb/raw) of the MetDB dataset (Met Office conditions of use apply).


Apologies for the inconvenience this may cause.
