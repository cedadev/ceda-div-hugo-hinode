Following a number of networking changes and upgrades that came into effect earlier today, users of the CEDA FTP service to access CEDA archives should now experience improved performance. 


 


The work to improve the CEDA service is part of an ongoing effort to develop streamlined network access to CEDA archives via a number of access options. The FTP service is the first of these improved services to be rolled out and we hope to deliver more in the coming months for both data users and providers.


 


Users are invited to make use of the improved FTP service by ftp-ing to [ftp.ceda.ac.uk](ftp://ftp.ceda.ac.uk) . However, should you encounter any difficulties please do not hesitate to contact [CEDA Support](/contact "Contact CEDA Support") for further assistance.
