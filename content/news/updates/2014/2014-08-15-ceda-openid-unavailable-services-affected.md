The CEDA open ID service has been restored for most CEDA supported services following a temporary issue that had arrisen in the last 24 hours.


However, the CEDA OpenID login service is presently unavailable for the CEMS PyDAP server: [http://dap.cems.rl.ac.uk/](http://dap.cems.rl.ac.uk/ "Link to CEMS pydap service")


CEDA staff are working to return this login service as soon as possible and we will post additional news items to keep users informed of progress. It is anticipated that this may be reviewed sometime next week due to present staff availability.


 


CEDA apologises for these temporary issues.


 


CEDA TEam.
