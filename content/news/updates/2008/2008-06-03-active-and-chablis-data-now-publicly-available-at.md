Data from the NERC ACTIVE consortium project (Aerosol and Chemical Transport In tropical conVection) and data from the NERC-AFI CHABLIS campaign (Chemistry of the Antarctic Boundary Layer and the Interface with Snow) are now publicly available at BADC.


 The ACTIVE project combined field measurements and a range of modelling tools at different scales to address questions related to the composition of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL).
Field measurements were conducted in Darwin, Australia in two phases: November-December 2006 (pre-monsoon convection), and January-February 2006 (monsoon convection). The ACTIVE dataset at BADC includes data from the Australian Egrett aircraft operated by ARA and the NERC Dornier 228 operated by the British ARSF whiich were used to measure chemical species and aerosol in the inflow and outflow of tropical storms. Ozonesonde soundings measured during the campaign are also available.


 CHABLIS was a major initiative to explore the atmospheric chemistry of the Antarctic boundary layer (ABL) in greater detail and for a longer period of time than has been achieved before.
Fieldwork was carried out at the Clean Air Sector Laboratory at Halley station. The field campaign started during the austral summer in January 2004 and continued throughout the winter culminating with an intensive study during the summer of 2004/2005. Major foci for CHABLIS included detailed studies of seasonal oxidant chemistry, annual variation in the boundary layer NOy budget and elucidating air/snow transfer processes.
