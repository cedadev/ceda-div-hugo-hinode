The BADC helpdesk will be unavailable from Wednesday 24th December 2008 to 4th January 2009. All queries received in this period will be answered as soon as possible on our return. 


 BADC Services will be running but should be considered *at risk* as there is no support during the holiday period.
This also applies to the data extractor which is having severe problems when put under pressure. Please only use the data extractor when essential over the holiday period and only put small and infrequent requests through, to avoid overburdening the system and causing a crash. Your assistance in this is appreciated. 

The Helpdesk team would like to wish all BADC users a
**Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!**
