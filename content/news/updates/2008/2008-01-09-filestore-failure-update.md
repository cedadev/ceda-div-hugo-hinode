Following the failure of one of the BADC filestores BADC staff have been able to re-establish access to the 4 affected datasets and Project Spaces.

The My Requests area remains offline at present as staff assess the state of the filestore. Thus the Data Extractor also remains inactive at present. .

Further announcements will be made via the BADC website and news service as the services are re-established.

Apologies for the inconvenience caused.
