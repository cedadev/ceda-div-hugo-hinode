Please note that due to unavoidable electrical work the BADC system will be offline for several hours on Saturday morning 16th February 2008. It is itended that the system will be up and running again by lunchtime. 

The NERC Data Discovery Service will be affected as well as other BADC/NEODC services.

Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause 



The BADC is pleased to announce that it is no longer necessary for applications for Met Office (and some other datasets) to require a signed Conditions of Use form to be posted to us. We realise this was a time-consuming part of the application process and are pleased that it is now a paperless system. You are still required to agree to the conditions of use and are advised to print the online form for your information.

You will receive a confirmation email when your application has been dealt with.
The paperless system has been in operation for a couple of weeks. Please let the [Helpdesk](mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk) know if you find any problems with the system.



The [MIDAS Surface data dataset](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ukmo-midas/) has now been updated to cover to the end of January 2008 in all UK tables. The Global Weather Observations data will be updated in due course. 


 
 
As always please let the [BADC Helpdesk](mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk) know if you experience any problems or have any queries.
