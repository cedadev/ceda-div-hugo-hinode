We are pleased to announce the launch of the new CEDA Repository.

The CEDA\* Repository is now available for storage of your documents, images, conference papers, theses, talks, videos, etc.
The repository has been developed to aid preservation and accessibility of documents and other digital items associated with Earth observation and the atmospheric sciences, which may otherwise be inaccessible to the general public.

Please visit the repository and deposit any suitable items.

Full details are given on the repository homepage - <http://cedadocs.badc.rl.ac.uk>

\* CEDA is the Centre for Environmental Data Archival, host to both the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) and NERC Earth Observation Data Centre (NEODC).
