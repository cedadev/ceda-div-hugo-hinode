The Clouds, Water Vapour and Climate (CWVC) Programme was a five-year NERC thematic research programme. Its overall aim was to improve our understanding of the physical processes responsible for the distribution of humidity and clouds and of their influences on climate. 
 
CWVC data submitted to the BADC include:
* [The Chilbolton Advanced Meteorological Radar (CAMRa) data set](/data/cwvc/camra/) (Projects GST/02/2316 and 2874).
* [The HITRAN water vapour absorption data set](/data/cwvc/hitran/) (Project GST/02/2871).
* [The EMERALD I and EMERALD II campaigns data sets](/data/cwvc/emerald/) (Projects GST/02/2881 & NER/T/S/2001/201).
* [The Global Retrieval of ATSR cloud Parameters and Evaluation (GRAPE) data set](/data/grape/) (Project NER/T/S/2001/205)


All the CWVC datasets held at the BADC are now all public.
