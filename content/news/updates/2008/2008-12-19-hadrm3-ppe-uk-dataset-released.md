The Met Office Hadley Centre Regional Model Perturbed Physics Ensemble simulations for the 21st Century for the UK domain (HadRM3-PPE-UK) are now available from the BADC.


 This dataset contains output from an ensemble of eleven variants of the MOHC Regional Climate Model (HadRM3), run from 1950-2099 and used to dynamically downscale global climate model (GCM) results as part of the climate change experiments carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the latest UK Climate Projections report.
