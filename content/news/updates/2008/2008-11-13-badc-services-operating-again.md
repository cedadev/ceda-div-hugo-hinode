The BADC services are now running after the network problems following the work at the weekend.

The data extractor is still running at risk, please bear with us while we work on the problems this service is having. 
It is being monitored regularly and we will endeavour to keep you updated on the progress of this service.

Many apologies for the inconvenience.
