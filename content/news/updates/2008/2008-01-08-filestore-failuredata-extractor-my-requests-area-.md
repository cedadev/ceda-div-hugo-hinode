Following the failure of one of the BADC filestores access to My Requests, Project Spaces, ECMWF trajectories, ISB52, NDSC and TOMS datasets is not possible at present.

BADC staff are working on this issue and hope to have the 4 dataset and the Project Spaces re-instated in the next 24-48 hours. The My Requests area will be re-instated soon afterwards, however it is unclear if existing user account data will be available. 


As a consequence of the unavailability of the Requests area the Data Extractor will also be affected and thus users are asked to wait until the Requests Area has been re-established before attempting to submit further requests.


Further announcements will be made via the BADC website and news service as the services are re-established.



Apologies for the inconvenience caused.
