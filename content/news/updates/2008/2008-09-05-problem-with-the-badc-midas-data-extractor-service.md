There is currently a problem with the BADC Data extractor Service in **extracting MIDAS data for a specific station (by src\_id)**. Extracting MIDAS data by geographical area (lat/long) or by county is not affected by this problem. 


 We are currently investigating the problem and are working at restoring the service as soon as possible.


 We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause in the meantime.
