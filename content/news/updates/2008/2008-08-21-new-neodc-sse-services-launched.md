NEODC is pleased to announce the launch of three new web services using the ESA Service Support Environment (SSE). The services allow the user to search and manipulate data online.

The new services allow extraction of subscenes and production of radiance logs from the AATSR data archive, as well as search and discovery of resources made available through the NERC DataGrid.
