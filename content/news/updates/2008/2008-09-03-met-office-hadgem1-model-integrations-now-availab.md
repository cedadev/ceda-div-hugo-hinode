The HadGEM1 model is the Met Office Hadley centre global environment model. This version of the model includes a detailed representation of the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and cryosphere. 
 
The HadGEM1 Model Integrations dataset includes a control run and a number of climate change experiments. Those currently available are listed [here](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/MO/hadgem1/latest_volumes.html).


 
More information about the HadGEM1 dataset and conditions of access can be found at:

 **Note** for those BADC users who had access to hadgem1 control run data as a separate dataset (*hadgem1-control*): The control run data is now part of the HadGEM1 dataset described above and can be found in the BADC archive under the hadgem1 directory.
