2. The monthly means for the ERA-40 Re-analysis Dataset
=======================================================

Two types of monthly mean are now available for the ERA-40 dataset. These are the:

i. Monthly diurnal means (moda) - calculated from all time steps in a given month (i.e. one mean per month).
ii. Monthly synoptic (6-hourly) means (mm) - calculated from all values of a given time of day in a given month (i.e. 4 means exist per month, at 00, 06, 12 and 18UTC).

Details on these means are now available at:

<http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ecmwf-e40/means.html>

SPECIAL NOTE FOR USERS ACCESSING ERA-40 MEANS DURING THE EXTRACTION PERIOD:
===========================================================================
Please note that during the extraction period (January - May 2003) some of the monthly mean files were incorrect. The means were not clearly visible and had not been advertised at this period so I am not aware of anyone having used them. 

However, if you did locate the means and you have used those located under one of the following directories then please obtain the new means as directed in the link above. The directories where errors occurred were /badc/ecmwf-e40/data/diags, /disks/tornado4/e40_means/mm and /disks/tornado4/e40_moda/moda. All the erroneous means were deleted on 20th June 2003.
