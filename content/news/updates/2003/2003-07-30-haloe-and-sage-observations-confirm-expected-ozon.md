 NASA satellite observations have provided the first 
evidence the rate of ozone depletion in the Earth's upper 
atmosphere is decreasing. This may indicate the first stage 
of ozone layer recovery.



 From an analysis of ozone observations from NASA's first and 
second Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and 
the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) satellite 
instruments, scientists have found less ozone depletion in 
the upper stratosphere (22-28 miles altitude) after 1997. 
The American Geophysical Union Journal of Geophysical 
Research has accepted a paper for publication on these 
results.


 
This decrease in the rate of ozone depletion is consistent 
with the decline in the atmospheric abundance of man-made 
chorine and bromine-containing chemicals that have been 
documented by satellite, balloon, aircraft and ground based 
measurements.


 
Concerns about ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere or 
stratosphere led to ratification of the Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer by the international 
community in 1987. The protocol restricts the manufacture 
and use of human-made, ozone-depleting compounds, such as 
chlorofluorocarbons and halons.


 
"Ozone is still decreasing but just not as fast," said Mike 
Newchurch, associate professor at the University of Alabama, 
Huntsville, Ala., and lead scientist on the study. "We are 
still decades away from total ozone recovery. There are a 
number of remaining uncertainties such as the effect of 
climate change on ozone recovery. Hence, there is a need to 
continue this precise long-term ozone data record," he said.


 
"This finding would have been impossible had either SAGE II 
or HALOE not lasted so long past their normal mission 
lifetime," said Joe Zawodny, scientist on the SAGE II 
satellite instrument science team at NASA's Langley Research 
Center, Hampton, Va.


 
SAGE II is approaching the 19th anniversary of its launch, 
and HALOE has been returning data for 11 years. Scientists 
also used international ground networks to confirm these 
data from satellite results.


 
SAGE I was launched on the Applications Explorer Mission-B 
spacecraft in 1979; the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite 
carried SAGE II into orbit in 1984. The Space Shuttle 
Discovery carried HALOE into space on the Upper Atmosphere 
Research Satellite in 1991.


 
NASA's Earth Science Enterprise funded this research in an 
effort to better understand and protect our home planet. The 
ozone layer protects the Earth's surface from the sun's 
harmful ultraviolet rays. Ultraviolet radiation can 
contribute to skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harm 
other animals and plants. Ozone depletion in the 
stratosphere also causes the ozone hole that occurs each 
spring over Antarctica.
