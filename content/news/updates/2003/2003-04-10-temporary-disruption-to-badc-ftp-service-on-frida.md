Temporary Disruption to BADC FTP service on Friday 11th April 2003 from 2pm
============================================================================


The power supply to selected BADC computers is being checked. This will result 
in the disruption of BADC FTP services from 2pm on Friday 11th April for about 
an hour.

Data will still be available for [download via the web](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser).

We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.

BADC Support 10/04/03.
