The Met Office has now stopped updating GISST/GIICE datasets.

HadISST 1.1 is the replacement product provided by the Hadley Centre at the The Met Office.
It contains monthly long-term global gridded SST and sea ice analysis (1870 to present).

This dataset was available from the Met Office as an historical dataset and is now being made 
operational (i.e. updated every month). HadISST has a different sea-ice analysis from GISST; as 
a consequence of this, the data will not be available until the 2nd of the month, 
2 months afterwards (e.g. January's data will become available in March).

To find out more about this new dataset and access restrictions, please read through the 
[HadIsst dataset web pages](/data/hadisst/).
