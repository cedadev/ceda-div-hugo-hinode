Temporary Disruption to BADC services on Monday 30th June 2003
==============================================================

   The BADC file server, Tornado, has experienced a hardware fault earlier 
   this morning.
   The fault appears to have been cleared after reseating the controllers.
   
   An engineer is still expected later today and we may need to take the 
   machine down for him to investigate the fault.

   We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.

BADC Support 30/06/03.
