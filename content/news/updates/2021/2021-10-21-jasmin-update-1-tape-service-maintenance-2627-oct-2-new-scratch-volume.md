Dear users,  
  
Please note the following updates for your attention:


1. Tape service maintenance 26/27 October 2021


There will be a downtime for tape services (affecting Elastic Tape, JDMA and the Near-Line Archive service) on Wednesday 27th October, to apply essential updates. All tape activity will need to be stopped during the work, so in order to drain the system, these services will be unavailable to users from Tuesday 26th October until the work is completed on Wednesday afternoon.


2. New scratch volume


A second, 1-Petabyte scratch volume is now available at the path /work/scratch-pw2 and on the same type of storage (Parallel File System or PFS) as the existing /work/scratch-pw. Please note that the same policies and background clean-up processes are in place for this storage, so please clean up after yourself to maintain sufficient storage for all users, and do not leave data there for any long periods of time.  
  
Kind regards,Â   
JASMIN Team
