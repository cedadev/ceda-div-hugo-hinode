Dear users


We are aware of reports of apparent file corruption affecting a relatively small number of files in some volumes with paths beginning */gws/nopw/j04*.  
We have been receiving assistance from the storage vendor to resolve the issue and measures are now underway to repair affected files. As we understand the situation at present, no action is needed by users at this time.


The vendor has provided updated software releases which were installed yesterday and file scrub/repairs have been running since last night. They expect the scrub processes (which are to find any other affected files) to take a few days to complete but a significant proportion of the user reported files were repaired over the weekend.


We will post further updates once more information is available.  
With apologies for any inconvenience,


JASMIN Team
