Unfortunately we are still having recurring problems with the Elastic Tape system. This has resulted in further failures of both ingesting and retrieving data.  
We are actively investigating this, in conjunction with our colleagues in the Scientific Computing Department (SCD). In particular our SCD colleagues have spent a lot of time trying to remedy this problem.


Could we once again please ask users not to try ingesting or retrieving data until further notice? We need to leave the Elastic Tape system running to carry out tests, but having user's requests mixed in with our tests makes it more difficult for us to diagnose the problem.


This affects both the Elastic Tape service and the JDMA service.


Many thanks and apologies for the continued interruption to these services.
