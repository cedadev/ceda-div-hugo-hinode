The below issue is now resolved.Â

We are currently experiencing some issues with the following CEDA Archive service:  
[dap.ceda.ac.uk](https://dap.ceda.ac.uk/)  
This will be causing some issues when you try to download data.  
You can still access and download data via FTP.  
See details about this [here](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/99-download-data-from-ceda-archives).  
We are working on resolving these issues and will update progress on here ASAP.  
Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
