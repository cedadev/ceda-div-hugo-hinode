Dear all,


1) Apologies for the short notice but the reboot of servers planned for today announced in our recent update is cancelled. This is due to the imminent availability of a newer release which will be rolled out in due course instead, timing TBC.


2) An engineer visit is scheduled for 14:30 for 2hrs this afternoon to address ongoing issues with the tape library. This will mean that the NLA and other tape services are unavailable for this period.


We apologise for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
