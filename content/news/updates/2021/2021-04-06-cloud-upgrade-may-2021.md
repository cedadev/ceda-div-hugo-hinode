Dear cloud tenants,


We are planning a major upgrade to JASMIN’s Cloud in May this year: The work will bring the cloud from the current “Queens” version of OpenStack to the latest compatible supported release, “Train”.


Unfortunately, the nature of the work means that an in-place upgrade will not be possible and therefore it will be necessary for tenants to redeploy their services from their existing tenancies to new tenancies running the updated version. We will provide a period of overlap in which we keep the existing cloud tenancies available whilst at the same time providing access to the new environment in order to support the migration process for users.


We will be in touch with you again nearer the time with specific dates and details about the migration process.


JASMIN Team
