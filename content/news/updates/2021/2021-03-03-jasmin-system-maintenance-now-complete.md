The scheduled maintenance that happened yesterday, Tuesday 2nd March 2021, is now completed.


Most JASMIN and CEDA services are back running as normal. However, there are ongoing issues related to access to MASS. We are working on resolving this ASAP.


If you spot anything that doesnâ€™t look right, please contact the helpdesk - making sure to include as many details as possible.


Thank you for your patience whilst we carried out this essential maintenance work.   
JASMIN team
