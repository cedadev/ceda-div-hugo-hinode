Scheduled maintenance is planned for tomorrow, Tuesday 2nd March 2021, which may cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services.


On a regular (roughly quarterly) basis, important updates are applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure (which also hosts the CEDA Archive and associated services) in order to keep them up to date and secure. Some servers may need to be rebooted in order for these changes to take effect, so there may be an interruption to some JASMIN and CEDA services on this date.  
Other work may also be scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption to users.


The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 06:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.


Please look out for further announcements nearer the date, and apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
