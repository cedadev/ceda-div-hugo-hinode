The server used to access the Elastic Tape service (**et1.ceda.ac.uk**) has reached its end of life and is due to be decommissioned.


A new server has been created with the name **et.jasmin.ac.uk.** This server contains all of the Elastic Tape tools: *et\_put.py, et\_get.py, et\_rm.py, et\_ls.py* and should now be used to access the Elastic Tape service via these tools.


On Thursday 21st January at 12:00, logins to **et1.ceda.ac.uk** will be disabled. This will allow any running ingestion or retrieval to complete but will not allow users to make any new ingestions (*et\_put.py*) or retrievals (*et\_get.py*) on **et1.ceda.ac.uk.** Once all of the ingestions and retrievals are complete, **et1.ceda.ac.uk** will be decommissioned.


The new **et.jasmin.ac.uk** server is ready to use and should be used for all ingestions and retrievals from now on.


We apologise for any inconveniences this may incur


Kind regards  
JASMIN Team
