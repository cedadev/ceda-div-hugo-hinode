As we approach the summer period, please be aware of the limited support arrangements in place which will result in CEDA and JASMIN services running “at-risk”.


  
Over the next few weeks, many of our staff will be taking annual leave. As a small team, this means that our ability to support the many aspects of our service will be reduced.


  
In particular, the first week of August (2nd - 6th) will have very limited staff working, so please consider CEDA and JASMIN services to be running "at-risk" during this period, with limited helpdesk support available. This also covers requests for access roles or other changes. 


  
CEDA websites, archives and services, including access to JASMIN, should be available during this period but if problems occur, these may take longer than usual to resolve. 


  
All user queries received during this period will be answered as soon as possible.


  
We hope you can also enjoy a well-earned break in the sun. 


  
Best wishes,   
JASMIN/CEDA team
