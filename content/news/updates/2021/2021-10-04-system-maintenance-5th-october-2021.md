Reminder: System Maintenance planned for 5th October 2021.


Scheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 5th October 2021, which will cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services. Systems will be “at risk” and may be unavailable for all or part of the day.


On a regular (roughly quarterly) basis, important updates are applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure (which also hosts the CEDA Archive and associated services) in order to keep them up to date and secure. Servers may need to be rebooted in order for these changes to take effect, so there may be an interruption to JASMIN and CEDA services on this date. Other system work may also be scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption.


The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 06:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.


Please look out for further announcements nearer the date, and apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused.
