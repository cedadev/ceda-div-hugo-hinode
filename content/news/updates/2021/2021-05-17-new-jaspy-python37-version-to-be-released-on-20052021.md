Dear JASMIN users,


We are pleased to announce that a new version of the JASPY Python 3.7 software environment has been released on JASMIN. It is currently ready for testing on the JASMIN "sci" servers and the LOTUS cluster.


This new release includes updates to a number of software packages as well as some new tools. The release, labelled as "jaspy/3.7/r20210320", is described on our Help Page at <https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs>


In order to activate the new JASPY release, you will need to type:


*module load jaspy/3.7/r20210320*


**On Thursday 20th May (9 am) we will be switching the default JASPY version to this new release.** Once the switch has happened, you will activate the new JASPY release by simply typing:


*module load jaspy*


Note that the previous JASPY release will continue to be available by using its full label: "jaspy/3.7/r20200606".  
  
Thank you for your attention and please look out for further updates.  
   
CEDA and JASMIN Team
