Dear users,


Please note the following updates:


**1. Network maintenance 14/15 & 21/22 August, at risk in between.**  
As part of work to upgrade the RAL core network (the network of CEDA and JASMIN’s host institution) to 100G, network components will be replaced during the weekend of 14th/15th August with follow-up work on 21st/22nd August. Connectivity between JASMIN/CEDA services and the outside world is expected to be disrupted over these 2 weekends to please plan your work accordingly to minimise inconvenience. The intervening week should be regarded as “at risk” and there is the possibility that changes made on the first weekend may need to be rolled back if the work cannot be completed successfully.


**2. Elastic Tape and JDMA now operational again**  
A reminder that these services, which provide access to near-line tape storage for group workspaces, are now operational again.
