Tomorrow, Wednesday 21st April, upgrades by our host institution to the RAL site firewall will be undertaken between 06:00 and 10:00. This will involve some disruption to all services using the RAL network: this includes JASMIN and CEDA services. Please be aware of this scheduled interruption so that you can plan your work accordingly.


With apologies for any inconvenience,


JASMIN TeamÂ
