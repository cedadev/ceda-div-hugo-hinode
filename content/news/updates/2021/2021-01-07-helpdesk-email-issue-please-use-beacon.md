UPDATE: The following email issue on the helpdesk has now been resolved.  
  
  
Dear users


We are aware today of an issue affecting emails to our helpdesks (support@ceda.ac.uk, support@jasmin.ac.uk and data.management@ceda.ac.uk).


Emails are being received, but an issue is currently preventing them reaching our helpdesk system. We are working to resolve this.


Please do not re-send any emails already sent. Meanwhile, if you have new issues to report, please use the help beacon feature (usually an orange or blue symbol, bottom-right on our websites) which enables you to submit support requests directly into the helpdesk system and bypasses this issue.


We apologize for any inconvenience and will update you on this issue in due course.


CEDA/JASMIN Team
