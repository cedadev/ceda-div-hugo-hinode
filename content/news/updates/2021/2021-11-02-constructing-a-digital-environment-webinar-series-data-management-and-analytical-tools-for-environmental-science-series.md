The Constructing a Digital Environment programme runs an active webinar activity. Held every three weeks, these aim to develop the digitally enabled environment to benefit scientists, policymakers, businesses, communities and individuals. We arrange our webinars predominantly into ‘series’, drawing together presentations following similar themes.


On 12 November, we will kick-off the fourth series led by the NERC Environmental Data Service (NERC EDS) and focusing on research data management and the analytical tools available to support researchers in the environmental sciences. The EDS provides a focal point for NERC’s scientific data and information. It consists of a network of five data centres which curate data from environmental scientists working in the UK and around the world. This series showcases the services provided by the EDS and illustrates how it supports the open data agenda. We will hear how tools developed by the EDS enable interoperability, support large-scale data analysis and facilitate multi- and trans-disciplinary research. Details of the first two webinars can be found below.


Friday 12 November at 11:00 GMT - Jaana Pinnick on ‘Research data management services provided by NERC EDS’


Friday 3 December at 11:00 GMT - Helen Glaves on ‘Open Science: what’s in it for me?’
