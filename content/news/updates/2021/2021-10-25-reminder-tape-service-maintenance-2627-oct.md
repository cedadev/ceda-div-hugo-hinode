Dear users


There will be a downtime for tape services (affecting Elastic Tape, JDMA and the Near-Line Archive service) on Wednesday 27th October, to apply essential updates. All tape activity will need to be stopped during the work, so in order to drain the system, these services will be unavailable to users from Tuesday 26th October until the work is completed on Wednesday afternoon.


Sorry for any inconveniences and thank you for your patience at this time.


JASMIN Team
