Dear users,


We are aware of an issue with some PFS storage volumes, including:  
  
1. /work/scratch-pw (but not /work/scratch-pw2)  
2. /gws/pw/j05/ncas\_obs  
3. (possibility of other volumes /gws/pw/j05/\*)  
  
These volumes may be temporarily unavailable. LOTUS users are advised to use /work/scratch-pw2 while this is investigated with the storage vendor.  
Please note that due to staff cover, response time on queries to the helpdesk may be slower than usual and we may not be able to respond to all queries individually. Please look out for further announcements.


With apologies for any inconvenience,


JASMIN Team
