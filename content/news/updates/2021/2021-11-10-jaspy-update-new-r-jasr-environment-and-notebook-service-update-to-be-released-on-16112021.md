Dear JASMIN users,


We are pleased to announce that (1) a new version of the Jaspy software environment, (2) a first (Jasr) R environment and an (3) update to the JASMIN Notebook Service software (using Jaspy) will be released on JASMIN on **Tuesday 16th November.**


1. The new Jaspy release includes updates to a number of software packages as well as some new tools. The release, labelled as "jaspy/3.8/r20211105", is described on our Help Page at [https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs.](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs)


**On Tuesday 16th November (9 am) we will be switching the default Jaspy version to this new release.** Once the switch has happened, you can activate the new Jaspy release by simply typing:


*module load jaspy*


Note that the previous Jaspy release will continue to be available by using its full label: "jaspy/3.7/r20210320".


2. For the first time, we have released an R software environment on JASMIN. This environment, known as "Jasr", is detailed at: <https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs#jasr-envs>.  
   
3. The new Jaspy environment (see above) will also be released as the default environment on the **JASMIN Notebook Service** (<https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4851-jasmin-notebook-service>) on Tuesday 16th November. Note that there is only one software environment on the Notebook Service so the previous environment will no longer be available once the change has been made.  
  
Thank you for your attention,  
   
CEDA and JASMIN Team
