Dear users,


Please be aware that due to scheduled network maintenance carried out by our host organisation, there will be a series of brief interruptions to network connectivity (a few seconds each) today, Wednesday 10th March 2021, between 09:00 and 10:30.  
These will affect network connections to the RAL site (and hence JASMIN and CEDA services), so may result in disconnected terminal sessions, interruptions to processing or data transfers in progress or availability of services.  
We are informed that the interruptions will also affect connections made using the Optical Private Network (OPN) connections to Leeds, Edinburgh and the Met Office.


Please regard the entire period 09:00 - 10:30 as “at risk”, even if connectivity returns before the end of that period.


We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.


JASMIN Team
