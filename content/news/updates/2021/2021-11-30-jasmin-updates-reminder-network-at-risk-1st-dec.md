**UPDATE: this work has now been postponed, please look out for further announcements. Apologies for the inconvenience, JASMIN Team.**


Dear Users,


On Wednesday 1st December at 10:00, there will be a network at risk period whilst reconfiguration of the RAL site network will take place.


While the intervention to change over to the new connection should be short, connections may be dropped and sessions interrupted.



We apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience at this time.  




Kind regards


JASMIN Team
