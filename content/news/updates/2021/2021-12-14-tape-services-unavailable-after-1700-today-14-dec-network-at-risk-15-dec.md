Dear Users,


In line with recent announcements regarding “at risk” status of tape services, please be aware that at 17:00 today, access to tape services will be closed in advance of RAL network reconfiguration work tomorrow Wednesday 15th December.  
A network intervention planned for tomorrow (17:00-21:00) should not affect most JASMIN services, but there is the possibility of some disruption. Access to tape services is being paused to minimise the risk of tape operations over-running into the intervention period.


With apologies for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
