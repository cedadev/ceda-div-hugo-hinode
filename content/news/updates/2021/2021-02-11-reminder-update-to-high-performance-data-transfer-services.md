Dear users,


As announced last week, the following servers will be decommissioned **tomorrow Friday 12th Feb**:


* **jasmin-xfer[23].ceda.ac.uk** (high-performance data transfer servers)  
now replaced by hpxfer[12].jasmin.ac.uk: please use these instead.
* **ftp.ceda.ac.uk** (CEDA Archive FTP server)  
The new host for this service will operate at the same name ftp.ceda.ac.uk, but if you have used the hostname ftp2.ceda.ac.uk directly, then you are advised to change to using the alias ftp.ceda.ac.uk so that the change happens transparently to you when the old server is decommissioned.


We have been aware for a while of an issue affecting transfers to and from some file system (particularly affecting transfers made using Globus) but this is still under investigation. Please look out for further announcements about this and replacement of the remaining high-performance data transfer servers.


Please also note [the scheduled maintenance day coming up on 2nd March.](/news/updates/2021/2021-02-23-advance-notice-jasmin-system-maintenance-tues-2-march-2021.md)
