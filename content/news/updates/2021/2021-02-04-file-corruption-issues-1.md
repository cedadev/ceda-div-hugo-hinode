Dear users


As reported last week, we have been dealing with an issue of apparent file corruption affecting a relatively small number of files in some volumes with paths beginning */gws/nopw/j04*.  
We have been receiving assistance from the storage vendor to resolve the issue and are now in a position to announce that the majority of affected files have now been successfully repaired, with no loss of user data. A process to scrub/repair a remaining list of some 1,281 files (as of earlier today) is now underway and should complete over the coming weekend. 1.4 billion files have now been checked by this process.  
The vendor has provided further updated software releases which have been applied and we are now confident that once the above process has been completed, there should be no further cause for concern.


With apologies for any inconvenience,


JASMIN Team
