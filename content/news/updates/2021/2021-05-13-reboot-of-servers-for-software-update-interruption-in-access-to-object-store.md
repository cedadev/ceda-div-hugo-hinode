Dear users,


Rescheduled work to apply a storage-related software update to key JASMIN servers (sci, xfer, hpxfer and a limited number of other machines) will take place on **Friday 14th May 2021 at 08:30-10:00**. A further intervention will take place during the day on **Monday 17th May** to reboot any servers which have not picked up the update automatically by then. In both cases, please look out for announcements at the console/command line on the machine. Sessions will be interrupted while the server is rebooted but you should be able to re-connect again after a few minutes when the machine has come back up.


Work to reconfigure network connectivity to allow external access to the object storage will take place at **08:30-10:00 on Friday 14th May 2021**. This may involve a very brief loss of connection from clients to the object storage, so the storage should be considered “at risk” during that window . This only affects access to the storage from tenancies in the JASMIN community cloud.


With apologies for any inconvenience,


JASMIN Team
