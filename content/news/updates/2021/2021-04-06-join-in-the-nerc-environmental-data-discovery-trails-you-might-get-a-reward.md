To improve the accessibility of data collected through NERC-funded research, or managed by NERC data centres and our collaborators, a NERC programme ([Constructing a Digital Environment](https://digitalenvironment.org/)) are collecting feedback on the user experience (UX) to improve the navigation of various web portals to assess these data. This is done via a series of events called the NERC Environmental Data Discovery Trails.   


The CEDA Archive website is part of the upcoming April events. Read below for more information about how you can get involved and help us to improve our data services.   



##### What are the Environmental Data Discovery Trails?



To gather feedback we are inviting you to take part in our [Environmental Data Discovery Trails](https://digitalenvironment.org/data-trails/). The events will run as short online quizzes, which will ask you to navigate a website and find the information linked to each trail. If you complete all of the feedback boxes you’ll be entered into a prize draw for a reward.


In April, we will launch two events to give you the opportunity to navigate “From present to past meteorology around the globe” following a trail through the Met Office WOW and CEDA websites. 


Those that complete the feedback boxes will be entered into the prize draws. After each event 10 participant names will be drawn to receive a NERC water bottle and single prize draw for £100 will be made. 


Don’t worry if you can’t find the answer or if it’s taking too long, just submit your comments as it is your feedback that we are after.  Post-event the trail link will remain available as an educational resource only.
