NERC is currently considering the Data Capability and Services that are provided via the NERC Environmental Data Service (EDS) and the associated data centres:


* British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC)
* Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)
* Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC)
* National Geosciences Data Centre (NGDC)
* Polar Data Centre (PDC)


NERC are keen to engage users of the EDS and the associated data centres to understand:


* how the capability and services they provide are being used
* what future requirements for data services or capability are needed to facilitate and/or support the user community.


A [Community Statements of Need Survey](https://engagementhub.ukri.org/nerc/eds/) is now live - the deadline for completing the survey is Monday 7th June.   
  
Once this survey has concluded the information will be collated and used to inform an assessment of Strategic Needs and further scoping around future data capability and services provided by the NERC. Outcomes of this will inform the scope of the EDS commissioning in 2023.


If you would like to participate the survey it can be found here via this [link](https://engagementhub.ukri.org/nerc/eds).  Further information about the Environmental Data Service can be found [here](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/).


If you would like any more information, have any questions, or if you are not currently a user of the EDS, but would like to share your thoughts about the current or future provision,  please do not hesitate to contact Andrea or Matt by emailing [SNAGEDS@nerc.ukri.org](mailto:SNAGEDS@nerc.ukri.org).


Many thanks,


NERC Digital Environment Infrastructure and Data Team
