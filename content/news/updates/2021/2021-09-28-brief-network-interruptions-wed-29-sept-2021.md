Dear Users,


We have been informed by the site network team for JASMINâ€™s host institution, RAL, that on Wednesday 29th September (tomorrow), the RAL site firewall will be upgraded. This work will be carried out between 07:00 and 09:00 BST. This upgrade will cause 2 short breaks (<1 minute) as the firewall is updated, but during the 2 hour upgrade window, access to systems should be considered at risk.  
Although brief, these interruptions may affect all CEDA and JASMIN services.


We apologize for any inconvenience and for the short notice.


JASMIN Team
