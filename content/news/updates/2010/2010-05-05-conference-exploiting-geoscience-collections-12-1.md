Geoscience collections (records, samples and digital data) are a key resource for research of all types. The compilation, management and exploitation of these resources are fundamental to a wide range of research activities. The conference will bring together an international range of users and custodians of geoscience collections.



This conference will take place at the Geological Society Apartments, London and is organised jointly by the Geological Curators Group and the Geoscience Information Group, both Specialist Groups of the Geological Society of London.
