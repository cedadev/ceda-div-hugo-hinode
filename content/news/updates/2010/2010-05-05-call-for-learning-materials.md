As part of JISC's new mandate to support the user community the Landmap Service has been tasked with acquiring new training materials to be added to the 10 module Image Processing course that they already offer. 

The Landmap Service are asking members of the academic community to come forward with ideas for new training modules.

Here are some ideas for extra modules for people to come forward to produce 


1. Integration of Landmap OGC (WMS, and WCS) and Image Streaming Services within teaching of GIS and Image Processing Courses. 


2. The use of Definien Enterprise Image Intelligence for the Classification of ASAR images available from Landmap 


If you would like to author one of the above modules please contact the Landmap Service at [spatial@mimas.ac.uk](mailto:spatial@mimas.ac.uk). Some financial recompense around Â£1500 will be offered to authors of these modules or suggested modules that are deemed suitable through this scheme. 


Authors will be expected to enter into a consultancy agreement with the University of Manchester and sign a copyright agreement that will allow Landmap to make the training materials available on the web site and for inclusion in JISC repositories of training materials.
