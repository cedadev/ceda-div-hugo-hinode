The NEODC joined other centres on the 5th March at the Royal Instition in London to mark the launch of NERC's National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO).



Scientists from the various Themes that make up the NCEO were joined by others from NERC, members of the media and Science Minister Lord Drayson. The event demonstrated not only the breadth of the challenges ahead, but also highlighted the strength of the skill base brought together by the centre to meet these challenges.
