We are currently encountering problems with our FTP server. The FTP service is reponding interminently, more often than not resulting in timing out sessions.



  This problem is unfortuantely also affecting some Met Office data updates (e.g. NIMROD)



 We are actively investigating the issue with our FTP server to restore a full FTP service as soon as possible.



  We are sorry for the inconvenience this is causing in the meantime.
