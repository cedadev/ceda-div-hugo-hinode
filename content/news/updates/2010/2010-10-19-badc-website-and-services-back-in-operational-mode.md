Some of the BADC servers unexpectedly went down yesterday, Wednesday 19th of October, early evening, resulting in the BADC Website and associated Services becoming unaccessible. The problem was however resolved early this morning and the BADC Website and BADC Services are now running as expected. 


 Should you still experience difficulties using the BADC Service, please contact [BADC Support](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/contact.html), preferably by email so that we can keep track of your enquiry.


 
We are sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused.
