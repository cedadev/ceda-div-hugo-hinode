The NEODC helpdesk will be unavailable from Friday 24th December 2010 to Tuesday 4th January 2011. All queries received in this period will be answered as soon as possible on our return.

NEODC Services will be running but should be considered at risk as there is no support during the holiday period.


The NEODC team would like to wish all NEODC users a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!


NEODC Helpdesk,
  
20th December 2010.
