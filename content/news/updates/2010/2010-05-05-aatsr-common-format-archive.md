A major project is underway at NEODC to create a common-format archive of products from the (A)ATSR series of instruments (i.e. ATSR-1, ATSR-2 and AATSR). 

This major new development for the NEODC is a DEFRA-funded project with the following scope:


* To produce and maintain an archive of consolidated AATSR and ATSR GBTR (Level lb) global 1 km data, the Level 2 averaged and gridded products, and Level 2 Meteo products. * To supply a consolidated set of the (A)ATSR Level 2 Meteo products to the Hadley Centre. * To provide (A)ATSR products to DEFRA and NERC scientific users


Work has begun in April 2005. This will be a hugely important dataset, bringing together a unique time-series of observations needed to address current scientific challenges. The archive will hold over 80TB of data, spanning 15 years. Data products will gradually become available from March 2006, and the entire archive is due to be complete in August 2007
