The 2009 Annual Student Meeting of the Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry Society is taking place in the Lake District on 14-16 April.


The meeting will give photogrammetry and remote sensing students the opportunity present their work to their peers as well as providing an easy-going atmosphere away from stuffy academic institutions to meet new people, network and have some fun! 


Being affiliated with the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Student Consortium the meeting should appeal to both UK based and international students. This should offer a broad range of topics and applications covering many aspects of photogrammetry and remote sensing research. 


The event will include keynote speakers, prizes for best presentation and poster and gorge walking!
