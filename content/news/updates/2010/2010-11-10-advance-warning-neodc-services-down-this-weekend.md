NEODC services will be down this coming weekend (evening of Friday 12th to Sunday 14th) and should be considered at risk at the end of this period while essential upgrades to the electricity supply at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory take place.



NEODC website and services will be re-instated as soon as possible once the work has been completed.

We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.
