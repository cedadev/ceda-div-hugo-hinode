Due to problems with one of our servers, "My requested data" directory which can usually be accessed via My BADC webpage, is currently not available. This is unfortunately also affecting the Data Extractor Service.


 
We are making every effort to restore access to My requested data and the Data Extractor Service as soon as possible.


 Apologies for the inconvenience this may be causing in the meantime.
