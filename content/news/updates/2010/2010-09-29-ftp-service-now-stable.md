Following the recent problems experienced by BADC users with our FTP server, the BADC Infrastructure Team has now successfully stabilized the service. 

Met Office data updates, NIMROD data in particular, has now also resumed.



 Should you however still experience difficulties with our FTP Service (e.g. timing out sessions), please contact the [BADC Helpdesk](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/contact.html) (preferably by email) describing in as many details as possible the problem encountered (e.g. copying and pasting FTP session in the email message). Thank you.
