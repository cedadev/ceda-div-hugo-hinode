The British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) and NERC Earth Observation Data Centre (NEODC) are participating in a study commissioned by the Research Information Network (RIN) and JISC to explore the long-term use and benefits of Research Data Centres. The study will be featuring the activities of a small number of well-established UK Data Centres, including BADC/NEODC, and aims to document the benefits and impacts that effective curation and sharing of research data can deliver to the scientific community and other users. The study is being performed by Technopolis Ltd.


As part of this study Technopolis Ltd is running a survey to collect feedback from our users, and we would be very grateful if you could contribute to this exercise by completing a copy of the questionnaire. The survey is being run on-line and you can access the questionnaire through the following link:

Technopolis Ltd estimate that the survey will take around 15-20 minutes to complete. Your answers will be saved automatically. 


All individual answers and comments will be treated as strictly confidential and will be non-attributable.


We would be grateful if you could complete the questionnaire by Friday 29th January 2010.
