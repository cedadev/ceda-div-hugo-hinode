A deployment of the NERC Airborne Research and Survey Facility to Ethiopia is planned for January 2008. The deployment will be undertaken primarily in support of a NERC Consortium Grant, based in northern Ethiopia, but there is potential for support of other projects in Ethiopia generally. Closing data for applications: 2nd July 2007.



Researchers wishing to make use of ARSF services are invited to submit by Monday 2 July 2007: 


1. Detailed proposals, including a supporting scientific case, to be received at Swindon Office; and 


2. Preliminary Risk Assessments for the ground-based element of the project. 


Please note that the latest application form and guidance notes must be used. Eligibility information and application forms are available via http://arsf.nerc.ac.uk/howtoapply/. 


The ARSF Steering Committee will review the applications using standard NERC criteria: successful applicants will be notified in early September 2007 of their inclusion in the flying campaign. 


The ARSF will undertake data acquisition, processing of and spectral/lidar data free of charge. It will be the responsibility of the Applicant to ensure that they have sufficient resources available to support the ground-based work and data analysis.
