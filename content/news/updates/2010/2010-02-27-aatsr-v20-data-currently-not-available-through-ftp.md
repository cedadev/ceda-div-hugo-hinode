The AATSR-v2.0 part of the AATSR\_multimission archive is currently unavailable through FTP (but is accessible via the NEODC Browse archive facility). 
We are working at restoring full FTP access to the archive as soon as possible.
We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause in the meantime.

NEODC Helpdesk.
