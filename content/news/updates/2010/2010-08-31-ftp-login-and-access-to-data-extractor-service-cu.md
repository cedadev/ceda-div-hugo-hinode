Technical problems with one of our servers is affecting FTP login to the BADC/NEODC archive and access to the Data Extractor Service. 


 While access to the BADC/NEODC archive via FTP and Data Extractor Service has been temporarily restored, it should be considered at risk until a permanent fix is applied.


 
Login to the BADC and NEODC websites is however NOT affected.


 
We are making every effort to restore permanent access to the FTP service and the Data Extractor Servive as soon as possible.


 Apologies for the inconvenience this may be causing in the meantime.
