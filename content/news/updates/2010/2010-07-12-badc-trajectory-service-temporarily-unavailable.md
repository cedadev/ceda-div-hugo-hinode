We regret that the BADC Trajectory Service is not currently available. While trajectory runs can apparently be successfully submitted, they don't actually run. We are investigating the issue in the hope to have the BADC trajectory service fixed shortly.


 Apologies for the inconvenience this may cause in the meantime.
