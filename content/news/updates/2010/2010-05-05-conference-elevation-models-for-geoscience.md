A one day conference "Elevation Models for Geoscience" will take place on Thursday 23rd March at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. The purpose of this public meeting is to examine the different types of elevation data available and to discuss their application within the Geosciences. 

This meeting builds on a successful internal NERC workshop that looked at how NEXTMap Britain has been used for different applications within NERC. The purpose of the public âElevation Models for Geoscienceâ meeting is to examine the different types of elevation data available and to discuss their application within the Geosciences. There is a strong programme covering the applications of elevation data from maps, SRTM, ASTER, airborne IfSAR, LiDAR and digital photogrammetry to mapping, Quaternary science, hazards and water resources. The Keynote presentation will be given by Dr. Robert Crippen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (read more  [here](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/profiles/crippen/index.cfm) ).
 
An exhibition is also planned during the meeting at the Geological Society and following the meeting there will be a social event, at the nearby Captain's Cabin Pub.
