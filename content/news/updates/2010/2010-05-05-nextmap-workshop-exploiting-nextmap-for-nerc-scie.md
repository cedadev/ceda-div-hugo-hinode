Registration is now open for the NEXTMap workshop at BGS Keyworth on 21st September.

The aim is to disseminate the results of using NEXTMap data for NERC science projects and studentships.
All NEXTMap users are encouraged to attend, registration forms must be returned by 2 September.

In early 2004, the high resolution NEXTMap Britain elevation dataset became available to NERC scientists. Since then, it has been used in over 50 projects in BGS alone, with other applications in CEH and in NERC research in the Universities. Eighteen months on, it is timely to assess progress and to demonstrate the capabilities of the dataset in anticipation of NERC purchasing the remaining national coverage. A workshop is taking place at BGS Keyworth, with the aim of disseminating the results of using NEXTMap data for NERC science projects and studentships.ï¿½
