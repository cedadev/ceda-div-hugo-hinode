A new version of the HIRDLS level 2 data - version 5.00 - has been released and is now available at the BADC.
1000+ days of data are available for 2005-2007. Data quality documents are also included.

 
Please note that due to a change in the toolbox used by the L2 processing software IDL users may need IDL-7.1 to read the data.


 More information and links to the data archive are available from the [BADC catalogue HIRDLS record](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/badc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__dataent_hirdls)


 Although this data is publicly accessible, please login when browsing the archive so that general usage statistics can be compiled for the HIRDLS management team.
