Data for the whole of Scotland have now been added to the NEXTMap Britain dataset available from NEODC.

The NEXTMap dataset, which is divided into OS grid 10 km x 10 km tiles, is available as 7 distinct products, varying in resolution from 5 to 50 metre cell size. For the recently added Scotland tiles however only diff, dsm, dtm and ori products are available (not dtm10, dtm50 or dtme). 


Further information about the dataset can be found on the [NEXTMap fact sheet](http://www.neodc.rl.ac.uk/?option=displaypage&Itemid=85&op=page&SubMenu=-1), including details of how to register to use the dataset.
