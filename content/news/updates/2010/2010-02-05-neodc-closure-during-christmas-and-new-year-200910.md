The NEODC helpdesk will be unavailable from Thursday 24th December 2009 to 4th January 2010. All queries received in this period will be answered as soon as possible on our return.

NEODCÂ Services will be running but should be considered at risk as there is no support during the holiday period.


The NEODC team would like to wish allÂ NEODC users a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!


NEODC Helpdesk,
  
23rd December 2009.
