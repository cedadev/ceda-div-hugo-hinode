Due to an electricity supply shutdown at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (23-24 March 2002), 
the BADC  File server (tornado) will be consequently temporarily shutdown from 
Friday 22th March at 4pm to Sunday 24th March. The BADC file server is expected 
to be back online from Monday 25th March.

This shutdown unfortunately implies that the BADC Web site and access to data 
and services will be temporarily unavailable.

We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.
