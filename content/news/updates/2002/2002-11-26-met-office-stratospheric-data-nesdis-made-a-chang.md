Met Office Stratospheric Data -  - NESDIS made a change to 
NOAA-16 processing affecting the stratospheric data
============================================================

Message from the Met Office:

"NESDIS made a change to NOAA-16 processing on 22/11/02, which they
expected to be null but has actually caused a significant degradation.
As a result it has been excluded from the observations since then.  This
has significantly effected the stratospheric data.  Efforts are being
made to rectify this problem and we hope to be able to carry out reruns
within a few weeks. Sorry for the inconvenience.

In addition to the NOAA-16 problems we have realised that we have been
failing to use NOAA-17 observations, which is why the impact of NOAA-16
failing was so severe.  We hope to begin using the NOAA-17 observations
operationally today, and reruns should follow."
