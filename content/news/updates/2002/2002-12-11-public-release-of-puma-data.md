Public release of PUMA data
===========================

The data collected during the two PUMA campaings of Summer 1999 and
Winter 2000 under the auspices of the NERC *Urban Regeneration and the
Environment (URGENT)* thematic programme have been released to the
public domain.
The data files are available  [online](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/urgent/data/pumaco/) for browsing or downloading.
A *quick look* facility allows the user to view the contents of each
file in a graphic mode.
