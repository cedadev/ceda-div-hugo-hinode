Met Office Stratospheric Data - now using OPERH identifiers
============================================================

The Middle Atmosphere Group at the Met Office has changed the data
assimilation model to include a bug fix that corrects a persistent
singularity over the South Pole in the stratosphere. It is only a minor
change, but as of yesterday's (26 Feb 2002) 12Z run, the assimilation
identifier has been changed from OPERG to OPERH (e.g. ppassm_operh_y02_m02_d26_h12.pp )

If you require any more details on this change, please contact the BADC
in a first instance. 

Thank You.
