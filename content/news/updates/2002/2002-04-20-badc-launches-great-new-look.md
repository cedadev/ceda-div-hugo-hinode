Â 


In July 2001, a user survey was sent by email to all BADC users
to solicit feedback about the BADC website and services provided
online.


The response rate was of 8% - all comments we received were
greatly appreciated and allowed us to spot strengths and weaknesses
in our website. Taking into account the users feedback, we re-designed
our web site to best meet users requirements. 


The new web site is a user friendly interface, easy to navigate
through using the tab menu system. All information and services
provided online should be easy to find.


New features include:



- extensive background information about the BADC including
 its history!
 - a "myBADC" section 
 - an informative page about data rules and policies
 - searchable BADC web site and a A to Z index of BADC webpages
 - an extended community page including Trajectory service,
 News items, Conferences calendar and new exciting services such
 as the collaborative workspaces to promote exchange betweeen
 registered users, a Poster Heaven where posters can be archived
 for reference and many more.
 - an extended Help central page

To find out more about our new web site, please read the 
site guide.



We hope you will enjoy browsing the new BADC Web site.
