A new batch of high resolution radiosonde data is now available from the BADC.
==============================================================================

The dataset now includes more recent data and data from extra stations. 
In particular 2 years of data from the Mount Pleasant (Falklands) site 
is included. Data from the Met Office autosonde sites will be made available 
as soon we have software to read it.

More information about the High Resolution data held at the BADC can be found at:
