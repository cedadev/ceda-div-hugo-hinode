Telnet connections to the BADC file server not supported from January 2003
==========================================================================

As of January 2003, connections to tornado, the BADC file server, through Telnet and rlogin  
will not be supported. However, connections through SSH are supported.

SSH stands for Secure Shell, a program to log into another computer over a network, to execute 
commands in a remote machine. 

SSH is a program very similar to Telnet.The difference is that SSH uses encryption to keep the 
connection secure so that it is more difficult for hackers to spy on users password or other 
sensitive information that may pass through the connection.

If you have an account on tornado, then you need to download and install an SSH 
client program onto your computer.

For more details including links to SSH downloads, please go to the [Help page](/help/software/ssh/)
