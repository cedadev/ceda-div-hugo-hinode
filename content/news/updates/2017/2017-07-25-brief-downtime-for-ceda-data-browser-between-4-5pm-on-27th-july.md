Access to the data browser at http://data.ceda.ac.uk will be briefly down between 4pm and 5pm on Thursday 27th July to apply a software update to the service.


There should only be a few minutes of downtime before the service is resumed as normal, but should be considered 'at risk' during this time period. 


We apologise for any inconvience caused. 


The CEDA team
