Due to a software problem, there has been some disruption to a number of CEDA services yesterday (Thursday 22nd June).   
  
These services include:


* ESGF Data Nodes (download/THREDDS)
* ESGF Index Nodes (search/user interface)
* Elasticsearch servers, providing data to the:
	+ EUFAR Flight Finder
	+ Sentinel OpenSearch service


Service has now been temporarily restored to the ESGF servers (except for access to SPECS data). However, we anticipate a strong possibility of further downtime in the next few days.


These problems have arisen after an update to the Linux Kernel on our systems that has stopped some Java applications working properly. We are currently awaiting news from Oracle who are hard at work trying to resolve this issue.


We will provide further information when we have it.


 


Apologies for any inconvenience this unforsable issue may cause whilst we work hard to resolve this.
