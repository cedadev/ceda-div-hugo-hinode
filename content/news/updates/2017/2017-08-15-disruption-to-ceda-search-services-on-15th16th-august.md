Â 


On Monday 14th August we began a software upgrade to services underpinning CEDA's geo-search services that has proved to be more complicated than anticipated. As a result, we will need to continue working on the services both today and tomorrow (15th-16th August). The work impacts the following services:


* Sentinel/satellite OpenSearch service: <http://opensearch.ceda.ac.uk>
* EUFAR Flight Finder: <http://flight-finder.ceda.ac.uk>
* Satellite Data Finder: http://geo-search.ceda.ac.uk


The work involves a major software upgrade of our ElasticSearch cluster (8 nodes). We will do our best to restore the services as soon as we can.


We apologise for any inconvenience caused.


The CEDA team
