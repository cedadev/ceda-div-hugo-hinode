CEDA are pleased to announce that Sentinel 3A SLSTR data are now available in our archive.


Following the launch of Sentinel 3A in February 2016, as part of the European Commission’s Copernicus programme for monitoring the Earth from Space, CEDA have been obtaining these data to support research and applications within the UK’s Earth Observation communities.


The Sentinel 3A Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) Level 1 RBT data are being mirrored on the CEDA archive from the ESA Data Hubs and are available for download or local access via the JASMIN infrastructure for large scale analysis


The CEDA archive already holds over 40TB of Sentinel 3A SLSTR products, from November 2016, and aims to have data available within 3 days of ESA releasing it. These data are open for access to anyone with a CEDA account.


CEDA plans to make further products from Sentinel 3A available in the near future:


* Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances at Full Resolution (EFR)
* Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances at Reduced Resolution (ERR)
* Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) Level 1 and Level 2 data
