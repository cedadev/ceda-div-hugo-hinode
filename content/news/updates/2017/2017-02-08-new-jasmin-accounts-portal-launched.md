We are pleased to announce the successful rollout of the new JASMIN Accounts Portal this morning. The new portal should be accessible at <https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk>.


 


Existing JASMIN users will need to migrate their JASMIN access settings from the CEDA portal - to do this, please visit <https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/account/ceda_claim/confirm/>.


 


A series of instructional videos has been put together demonstrating basic use of the new portal - these can be found at <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyBwrm7gQcuV3I1zrI8Rop2WgEP6vPXJL>. The JASMIN documentation has also been updated - please see the new "[Getting started with JASMIN](http://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/189-get-started-with-jasmin)" documentation covering the new JASMIN Accounts Portal.


 


Thank you for your patience during this migration. We hope that the new portal will improve your experience of managing your JASMIN services.


 


If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us by emailing [support@ceda.ac.uk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk).


 


Thanks,


The JASMIN Team
