CEDA have filled the archive space allocated for the Sentinel mirror data archive.


The recent power outage has further delayed our efforts of moving older data to the Near Line Archive (NLA). This allows archive space to be allocated to new and gapfilling data.


CEDA currently have 64TB of Sentinel data on the transfer cache. As soon as the NLA transfer process allows allocation of new archive space we will begin moving this data to the archive for users to access. Gapfilling will proceed with the most recent data first.


CEDA have recently updated systems to improve the mirroring of the ESA hubs. These improvements include increasing the number of source hubs used and streamlining the allocation of older data to the NLA. CEDA are also updating reporting tools visible to users so users can see the current archive and cache status on a daily basis.

CEDA will also shortly begin the mirroring of Sentinel2b and Sentinel3a L2 data.


  
We apologise for any inconvienace caused.
