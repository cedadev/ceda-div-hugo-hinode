We are pleased to report that the issue affecting the EUFAR Flight Finder & Sentinel OpenSearch service has been resolved and the services are now running again. Apologies for any inconvenience caused by the downtime.


Note that this problem was identified as being different from that which is affecting our ESGF services. We are still looking into the latter issue and we will provide an update when more is known about the problem.
