Please be aware that on Monday 17th July the JASMIN Analysis Platform (JAP) software stack will be updated to the latest version across LOTUS compute hosts.


A reservation has been put in place on the LOTUS batch processing cluster to drain it of jobs so that all hosts can be updated at the same time, scheduled for 08:00-11:00 on 17th July, although the task is expexted to take less than 1 hour.


This means that jobs on the long-serial queue are unlikely to start from today until the end of Monday's reservation. The system team may be able to "force start" long-serial jobs between now and Monday *only* for jobs that do not make use of any of the JAP packages.


Â 


Please note that the above applies in addition to the JASMIN storage downtime planned for tomorrow Wednesday 12 July.
