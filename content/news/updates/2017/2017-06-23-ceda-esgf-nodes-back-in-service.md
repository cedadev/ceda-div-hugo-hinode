The ESGF nodes at CEDA (search and download services) are now back in  
operation.


We are using a memory setting which allows the existing Java version to be  
used with the recently upgraded Linux kernel. This works, but we have not  
evaluated any performance impacts. Please contact the CEDA helpdesk in the  
event of any problems.


Sorry for the earlier inconvenience.
