Yesterday CEDA rolled out a new, improved web download service, paving the way for improved usability of the CEDA Archive: available now at:


[**http://data.ceda.ac.uk/**](http://data.ceda.ac.uk/)


The new service combines the strengths of "[**OPeNDAP technolog**](http://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/846-ceda-opendap-service)y" and some old familiar CEDA web tools such as multiple downloading tool and NASA Ames plotting.


With the new service users can :


* download batched of files in one go
* plot NASA-Ames formatted data
* Use WGET scripts to bulk download data
* Integrate downloads via the OPeNDAP service into commonly used scripting languages (e.g. IDL, Matlab and Python - more details to come)
* Subset and extract data directly from netCDF files - including getting ASCII output from these subsetting tools.


We hope to continue to develop this service to add further functionality to this new service.
