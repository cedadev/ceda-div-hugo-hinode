CEDA services will be available but unsupported over the bank holiday weekend - this also includes Tuesday 29th August. This includes services such as the CEDA archive, JASMIN and helpdesk; so any issues will not be resolved until after the weekend.


Normal support will return on Wednesday 30th, please bear with us until this time. May we also take this as a chance for a general reminder that CEDA/JASMIN are always unsupported over a weekend. 


We apologise for any inconvenience caused.


The CEDA team
