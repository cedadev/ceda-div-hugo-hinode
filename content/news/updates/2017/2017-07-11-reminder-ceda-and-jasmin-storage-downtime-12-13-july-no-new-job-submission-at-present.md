**All**JASMIN and CEDA users are reminded of the scheduled down time period 12-13th July to allow for essential storage infrastructure upgrades to take place.


The affected storage includes all Group Workspaces, the CEDA Archive (/badc, /neodc) all user home directories. 


ALL areas of JASMIN where this storage is mounted will be unavailable for this time, including:


* login servers
* transfer servers
* scientific analysis servers
* LOTUS processing cluster
* project-specific servers
* CEDA Archive and other services which rely on JASMIN storage
* Cloud tenancies in the managed infrastructure


 


The work is NOT expected to affect tenancies in the JASMIN Unmanaged Cloud, or other services which do not rely on the storage.


 


Please see our earlier news posting for further details: <http://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/advance-notice-ceda-archive-and-jasmin-storage-downtime-12-13th-july/>


 


**Additionanally, any LOTUS jobs scheduled to finish beyond 07:00 Wednesday 12 July will not be scheduled to start until after the maintenance work has completed.**
