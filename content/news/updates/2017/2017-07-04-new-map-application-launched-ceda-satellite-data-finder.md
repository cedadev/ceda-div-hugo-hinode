We are very pleased to announce a **new map-application** for locating scenes and scans from a range of Earth Observation data sets held in the CEDA archive. The [CEDA Satellite Data Finder](http://geo-search.ceda.ac.uk/ "Try out our new map application to find satellite data in the CEDA archives")Â provides spatial, temporal and satellite filters for data from the following satellite missions:


* Landsat 5, 7 and 8.
* Sentinel 1, 2 and 3.


Each scene or scan is represented as a polygon overlaid on the map. You can click on a polygon to view information about the file, how to access it and, where available, view a quick look plot.


Getting started
---------------


Please [watch the tutorial](http://geo-search.ceda.ac.uk/docs/SatelliteTutorialVideo.mp4) for guidance on how to get the most out of the application:



There are **over 1,000,000 satellite scenes** stored in the database so the interface can be easily overloaded by broad selections. The video provides a nice walk-through of how you can use the Temporal Filter, Rectangle Search and Satellite Filter to find only the data you need.


Please also take a look at the help page (<http://geo-search.ceda.ac.uk/docs/user/site/>). This explains that **only the first 1000 results will be overlaid** on the map with the most recent displayed on top. This limitation avoids performance problems and cluttering of the interface.


Try it out!

When you are ready to get started you can find the application here:
