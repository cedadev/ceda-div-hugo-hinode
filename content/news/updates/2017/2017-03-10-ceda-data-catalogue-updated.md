The CEDA Data Catalogue was updated lastnight to version 1.1.3.


The latest version includes:


* Links to download stats for each dataset record.
* HTML rendering in "Latest news" items at top of dataset record page.
* Updated data download links to CEDA's new [Web Download Service](http://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4431-ceda-archive-web-download-and-services "CEDA Archive Web Download Service").
* Updated [listing of datasets with licences permitting commercial use](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/listings/commercial_use/).


We hope these minor tweaks to the service will continue to enhance the usability of the catalogue for both data users and data providers.
