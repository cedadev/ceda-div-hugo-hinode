1) A further update on Tuesday's storage issues:


Storage systems affected by the issues earlier this week have now been restored to their original management configuration so no longer need to be considered "at risk". However there is still some high load in that part of the system which may still result in a slow response for the time being. Affected services/data/volumes are:


 


* /datacentre/archvol/pan23 (CEDA archive)  - affecting access to:
	+ FAAM
	+ MSG
	+ Met Office Nimrod data
* /datacentre/archvol/pan67 (CEDA archive) - affecting access to:
	+ ARSF
	+ IASI Metop B
	+ Some AATSR multimission data
	+ Some CMIP5 data
* CEDA Download stats service
* /group\_workspaces/cems/nceo\_aerosolfire
* /group\_workspaces/cems/nceo\_uor
* /group\_workspaces/cems/npl\_eo


 


2) Planned maintenance work on CASTOR (the system underlying Elastic Tape and the Near-Line Archive services) previously announced for 17th October has now been postponed to a provisional date of Tuesday 24th October. Further confirmation will follow in due course but the service should be operational as normal on Tuesday 17th October.
