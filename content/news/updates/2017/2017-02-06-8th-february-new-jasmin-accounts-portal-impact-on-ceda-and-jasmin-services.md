The new JASMIN Account Portal launch will be completed on 8th February and will require the myCEDA service to be offline for the inital stages of the migration.  
  
All CEDA and JASMIN users should note the following impacts to their services during the migration:

### CEDA Archive and data depositors users

Access to the "myCEDA" accounts portal will be unavailable during the day, preseventing users from updating their account details. Users will also be unable to submit any applications for resources during this time. Access to all other CEDA services, including logging into access restricted resources, should be unaffected.

### Existing JASMIN/CEMS Users

Access to the myCEDA accounts portal will be unavailable during the day and users will need to complete their account migration process to ensure continued access to CEDA Archive data resources within the JASMIN system. Further instructions will be posted once the new JASMIN Accounts Portal has been releasedl. Additionally CEMS users will be renamed as "JASMIN" users to help streamline the JASMIN user experience.

### New JASMIN Users

No new JASMIN users will be permitted to apply for a JASMIN login account once the service migration has begun. Outstanding applicaitons will be handled manually by CEDA staff following the successful role out of the JASMIN Accounts Portal. All subsequent users wishing to obtain a JASMIN account, inlcuding Cloud users, will need to use the new JASMIN Accounts Portal.Â 

### JASMIN Service Approvers

Approvers of existing JASMIN/CEMS GWS and VM applications should email the CEDA helpdesk with their decisions. New applications submitted under the JASMIN Accounts Portal will be alerted to approprioate authorisers directly, inviting them to log into the new Accounts Portal to process the applications themselves.
