The BADC contact details are now available from WAP phones. 
WAP stands for Wireless Application Protocol, and is a world wide standard developed 
especially to allow mobile phones to access the Internet. 
Normal web sites on the World Wide Web would take too long to download over 
a mobile phone connection, and the detailed graphics would be too small to read 
on a handset display, so WAP takes just the important parts and displays them 
as text. 


 
You'll need a WAP-enabled handset to access the 
WAP BADC contact details.


 You can access BADC contact details by bookmarking our WML address on your Wap phone:
