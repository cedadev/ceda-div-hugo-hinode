UARS Colleagues:

We have some "Very Sad News" to report.

We were informed on Friday, July 20, 2001, that a final decision to
shut off UARS instrument operations on September 30, 2001, has 
been made at NASA Headquarters.  Given the positive response that we
received at our May meeting with Jack Kaye, Ghassem Assarar, and
Mike Luther, we thought that UARS measurements would continue for at 
least part of FY02.  We were encouraged to develop a minimum cost plan
for operations through December 31, 2002, and this had been our principle
activity up until Friday.

We were totally surprized and extremely disappointed by this decision
and we don't know if anything can be done to reverse this decision.  

No final decision has yet been made concerning the disposition of the
UARS and it is still possible that a retrieval will occur.  Also, there
has yet been no final decision concerning the final archiving of the
UARS data.

It is possible that this message is not reaching everyone with interests
in the UARS.  Please send it on to anyone who you think might need to
be informed about this decision.

This is all the information that we and Mike Kurylo (UARS Program Scientist)
have at this time.  We will inform you if we hear any other information.

Sincerely,

Charles Jackman             and         Anne Douglass
UARS Project Scientist                  UARS Deputy Project Scientist
