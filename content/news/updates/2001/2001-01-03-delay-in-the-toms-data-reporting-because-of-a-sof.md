Delay in the TOMS data reporting because of a software problem at NASA
=================================================================

Leap year glitch - there was a problem in the NASA software in the ground control 
center such that the leap year was not being handled correctly. 
Data for December 31st was being assigned to January 1st. Leap years in the past 
were handled correctly by this software, so it not clear why it failed this time 
and it is taking longer to track down the problem than expected. 

Earth Probe is fine and Nasa has not lost any data. Nasa hope to have everything 
back on line tomorrow (the 4th).
