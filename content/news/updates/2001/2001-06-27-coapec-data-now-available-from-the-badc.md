The Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Processes and European Climate (COAPEC) dataset is now available from the BADC.


 
COAPEC is a NERC thematic programme designed to examine the variability of the Earth's climate. The goal of COAPEC is to determine the impact on climate, 
especially European climate, of the coupling between the Atlantic Ocean and the atmosphere. This is currently a 100 year dataset derived from the HadCM3 model, 
and the years covered by the dataset are 2079 - 2178.
