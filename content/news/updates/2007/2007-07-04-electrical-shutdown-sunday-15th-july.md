 Due to an electricity supply shutdown at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory on Sunday 15th July 2007, the BADC website and services will not be available for much of that day. We are taking the opportunity of this period of downtime to deal with planned disk upgrades. 
BADC services will be available again on Monday 16th July.
 
We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.
