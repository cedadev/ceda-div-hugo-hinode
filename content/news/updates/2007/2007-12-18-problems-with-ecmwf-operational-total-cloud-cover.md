The ECMWF has announced that due to some fields not initialising properly all analysis total cloud cover data within the ECMWF operational data are unreliable. Therefore, the BADC has removed such data from its ECWMF operational data archive and is writing to inform present users of the ECMWF operational data of this.



A 24 hour forecast TCC field has been generated from the +24 hour forecast fields and has been placed in the archive. These data are available from 01012002 to 01112007.


If you require further information regarding these changes please contact the [BADC helpdesk](mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk).



The BADC helpdesk will also be unavailable from 3pm Friday 21st December 2007 to 9am 2nd January 2008. All queries received in this period will be answered as soon as possible in the New Year.



Finally, the Helpdesk team would like to wish all BADC users past and present a
