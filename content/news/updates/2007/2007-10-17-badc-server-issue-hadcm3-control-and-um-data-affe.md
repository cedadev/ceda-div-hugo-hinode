Following a technical issue with one of our servers the entire HADCM3-control data and approximately 1/6th of the UM data are currently unavailable.

We hope to have the HadCM3-control data back early next week and will endeavour to have the UM data re-instated into the archive as soon as possible.

Further news items will be posted as progress is made.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused.
