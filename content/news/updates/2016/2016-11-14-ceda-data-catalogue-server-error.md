A number of CEDA services are presently being affected by an underlying issue with our login authentication service.


This issue is being worked on at present and we hope that full service will be resumed soon.


Users of the following services will encounter issues when they are either already logged in or requested to login:


* CEDA data catalogue (please log out of your account before attempting searches)
* CEDA Web Processing Service - all services requiring login are affected
* CEDA OPeNDAP service - access to public datasets is unaffected


Further news items will be posted as this issue is resolved.


Apologies for any inconvenience this issue may cause.


CEDA Team
