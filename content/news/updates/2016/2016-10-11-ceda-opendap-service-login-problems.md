Users of  the CEDA OpenDAP service (dap.ceda.ac.uk) are presently experiencing an issue whilst logging into their account to access resources on this service.  
  
CEDA have identified the cause of this issue and are seeking to resolve this later this week and we will update users when this service is fully functional again.


Users can continue to access data from the CEDA archives via [FTP](ftp://ftp.ceda.ac.uk "Access the CEDA archives via FTP") and [HTTP](http://browse.ceda.ac.uk "Access the CEDA archives via the CEDA Browse service") (for Earth Observation data click [here](http://browse.ceda.ac.uk/browse/neodc "Click here for Earth Observation data")).


CEDA Team.
