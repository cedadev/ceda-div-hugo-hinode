CEDA will be moving over to a new helpdesk system from 1st October to further enhance support for CEDA archive and service users and to offer greater support to JASMIN users.


The new helpdesk system will provide cleaner and clearer correspondence with our user community and will integrate into CEDA's new help documentation site: [help.ceda.ac.uk](http://help.ceda.ac.uk "CEDA and JASMIN Docs site")

We hope that the transition will occur smoothly and lead to an improved user experience overall.
