 ECMWF recently updated the licensing for its ERA products and in light of this CEDA have secured a new licence for all ERA products held in the CEDA archives.


This new licence permits use of these products for:


* Research purposes
* Educational purposes
* Commercial purposes, including the provision of services


The new licence also allows non UK users to access these data via CEDA.


#### Licence Conditions and Archive Access


Access to all ERA products has now been opened up to any registered CEDA user via our usual download services. Additionally all users of the JASMIN and CEMS data analysis platforms now have direct read access to these data in the archives from within the JASMIN and CEMS environments.


Please note - in all cases use is only permitted in strict accordance with the licencing conditions - you can view the new licence here:

#### Operational Data


The above changes only affect access to the ECMWF ERA products (ERA-15, ERA-40, ERA-Interim) held in the CEDA archives. ECMWF Operational data remains under its present licence, limited for UK-based academic use only.


 


We hope that these changes will facilitate our communities to make greater use of these data. Should you have any additional questions please do not hesitate to contact [CEDA Support](/contact/ "Contact CEDA Support").
