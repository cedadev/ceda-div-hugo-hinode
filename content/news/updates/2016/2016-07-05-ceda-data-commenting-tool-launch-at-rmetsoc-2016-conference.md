CEDA will be formally launching a new community data comments tool at this year's joint Royal Meteorological Society and NCAS conference as part of the CEDA data catalogue service.


This tool enhances use of the archive by allowing the archive user community to share new information about data CEDA holds, such as:


* Links to journal papers written using the data
* Links to other documents related to the data such as technical reports, calibration informaiton etc.
* Warnings about potential data issues users have identified
* Links to other relevant datasets held outside the CEDA archives


You can find out more about this tool and see a demonstration video here:


<http://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/208-dataset-comments-tool>


This new tool utilises the FP7 funded CHARMe service, also used by various agencies across Europe. For more information about CHARMe visit: [charme.org.uk](http://charme.org.uk "Visit the CHARMe website for more information about the CHARMe data annotations project")


If you have any questions feel free to [contact us](/contact/ "Contact CEDA for more information about data annotations") to discuss this further or come along to the CEDA trade stand at this year's joint RMetSoc/NCAS conference in Manchester and pick up some CHARMe goodies!
