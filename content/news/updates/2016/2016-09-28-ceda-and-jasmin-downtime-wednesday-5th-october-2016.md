As previously announced, in order to upgrade network switch firmware within the JASMIN core network, a downtime is planned for the entire day of Wednesday 5th October 2016. This downtime will affect all JASMIN services, the LOTUS processing cluster and all CEDA services which rely on the JASMIN infrastructure, including ALL access to the CEDA archive.


This is the first downtime of its kind since February 2015.


Apologies for any inconvenience,


CEDA / JASMIN team
