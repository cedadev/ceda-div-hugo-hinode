The CEDA trajectory service is presently off-line due to systemic issues with this unsupported service.


Following initial investigations into the cause of the problems and following an internal review, we have decided to fully decommission the trajectory service.   
  
The service has had very low usage in recent years and the service's code base is both very old and running on obsolete technologies that CEDA no longer supports.   
  
It is our intention to package the code and make this publicly available, should another organisation wish to take on its provision, user support and ongoing maintenance. This will be made available shortly, alongside all available documentation on the following public Git site:


<https://github.com/cedadev/badc_traj>


  
Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause you.
