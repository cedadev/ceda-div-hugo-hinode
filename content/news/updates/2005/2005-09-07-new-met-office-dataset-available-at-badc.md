The HadAT data are global radiosonde gridded temperature anomalies at standard 
levels in the troposphere and in the lower stratosphere from 1958 to present. 
This dataset supersedes the [HadRT](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/hadrt/) dataset.
 All values are anomalies relative to the monthly 1966-95 climatology. 

This dataset is restricted to academic research use only.



More information about this dataset can be found at: <http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/hadat/>
