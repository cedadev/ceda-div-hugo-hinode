Version 6.1 data are available from October 1984 through July 2000, 
in the form of index files and spec files, with software to assist processing 
in IDL. 
 
Version 6.2 is now available, with data through to January 2005. 


 
The update from 6.1 to 6.2 rectifies an altitude registration problem, and there is an improvement to the water vapour product.
