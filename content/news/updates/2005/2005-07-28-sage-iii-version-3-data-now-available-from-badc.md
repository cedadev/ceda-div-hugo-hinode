The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) was successfully launched onboard a Meteor-3M spacecraft on December 10, 2001. 
The satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit with an ascending node time of about 9 AM. 
Routine measurement operations began in March 2002. 
 
The specific measurement objectives of SAGE III provide 1 km vertical resolution profiles of:
* aerosols and clouds at seven wavelengths from the mid-troposphere into the stratosphere and 
where appropriate, the mesosphere;
* O3 from the mid-troposphere to 85 km;
* H2O from the planetary boundary layer to 50 km;
* NO2 from the tropopause to 45 km; NO3 from 20 to 55 km;
* OClO from 15 to 25 km;
* O2 from the mid-troposphere to 70 km
