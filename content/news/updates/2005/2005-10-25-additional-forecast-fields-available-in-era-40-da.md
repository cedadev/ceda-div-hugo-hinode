We have recently added some additional forecast fields available to the ERA-40 dataset held at the BADC. Due to user demand additional single/surface level forecasts have been extracted as follows in the ERA-40 archive: 

 
1. "Maximum/Minimum temperature at 2m since previous post-processing"
(MX2T/MN2T) are available at additional forecast steps of +3/+6/+9/+12 hours from both the 00hr and 12hr analyses. Sampling the data at this frequency captures the maximum (or minimum) between each post-processing step (3-hourly frequency).
2. A number of other variables are available at additional forecast steps of +6/+12/+18/+24/+30/+36 hours from both the 00hr and 12hr analyses. These variables are mainly moisture-related fields that are accumulated with time. The data was extracted to allow greater investigation into moisture-related fields within the ERA-40 dataset.
The variables are:
	* Snow evaporation (accum.) [ES]
	* Snow melt (accum.) [SMLT]
	* Large scale precipitation fraction (accum.) [LSPF]
	* Large scale precipitation (accum.) [LSP]
	* Convective precipitation (accum.) [CP]
	* Snow fall (accum.) [SF]
	* Evaporation (accum.) [E]
	* Runoff (accum.) [RO]
	* Instantaneous surface moisture flux (evaporation) [IE]
	* Convective snow fall (accum.) [CSF]
	* Large scale snow fall (accum.) [LSF]
	* Wind gusts at 10 m [10FG]
	* Boundary layer height [BLH]
