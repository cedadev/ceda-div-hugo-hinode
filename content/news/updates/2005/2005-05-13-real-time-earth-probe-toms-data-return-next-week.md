The satellite ephemeris problem has been solved and NASA is now evaluating 
the accuracy of the new files. You should begin to see [TOMS data and images](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/toms) early next 
week (May 23, 2005). It should then take only a couple of days to fill in all 
of the data back to April 15, 2005.
