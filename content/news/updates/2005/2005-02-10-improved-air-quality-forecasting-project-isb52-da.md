Data from the Improved Air Quality Forecasting project (ISB52) funded by the 
UK HM Treasury Invest to Save Budget is now publicly available at the BADC. 


 
Project collaborators were the University of Essex, University of Salford, 
the Met. Office and QinetiQ. The aim of the project was to develop a better 
understanding of the 3-dimensional air flow within the atmospheric boundary 
layer by using two identical Doppler lidars: the UFAM (Universities Facility
 for Atmospheric Measurement) Doppler Lidar operated by the University of 
Salford and QinetiQ's Doppler lidar. The project compared parameters derived 
from the lidar measurements taken during field experiments in March and July 
2003 with inputs used in the Met Office air quality forecasting model using 
software developed by the University of Essex.
