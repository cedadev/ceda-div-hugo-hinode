The data collected during the North Atlantic Marine Boundary Layer EXperiment 
(NAMBLEX 2002) has now been released to the public domain. NAMBLEX, which took 
place during July-September 2002, was an atmospheric composition campaign to 
study the oxidation processes, atmospheric chemistry and composition of a 
number of species primarily in the marine boundary layer.
 
Participating institutions were the Universities of Leeds, York, East Anglia, 
Leicester, Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, UMIST, Lancaster and Cambridge and 
involved had a major contribution from 
[UFAM](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ufam/) instruments.
