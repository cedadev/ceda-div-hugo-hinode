Unfortunately, since mid-August 2005, our remote access to the Met Office network 
and archives has been disabled by the Met Office.


 This means that we are currently not able to update the Met Office Global Radiosonde dataset 
and we are also not able to provide a Data on Request service for Met Office Land Surface data updates.


  We are actively working at restoring our remote access to the Met Office archives but we cannot say how long the process will take.


  If you need the data in earnest, then we advise you to contact the [Met Office Customer Centre](/no-longer-available) directly.


 A News item will be displayed on the BADC website as soon as we will be able to resume data extractions.
 We are very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause in the meantime.
