 Following the unexpected disk failure on 12th November, access to the following datasets is still affected:


- [CLOUDMAP](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cloudmap/)

- [Climate Impacts LINK Project](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/link/)
 However access to the following datasets has now been restored:
- [MST](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/mst/)

- [TOMS](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/toms/)

- [UK Met Office NIMROD rain radar dataset](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/nimrod/)

- [NDACC: The Network for the Detection of Amtopsheric Composition Change](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ndsc/)



Our staff are working to replace the disk at present. CLOUDMAP, NDACC and LINK data are currently being migrated to another disk.


Further updates will be provided by future news item postings on the BADC website and RSS feed.


We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause in the meantime.
