 Due to another unexpected disk failure, access to the following datasets is currently affected:


- [cloudmap](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cloudmap/)

- [MST](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/mst/)

- [NDACC: The Network for the Detection of Amtopsheric Composition Change](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ndsc/)

- [TOMS](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/toms/)

- [UK Met Office NIMROD rain radar dataset](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/nimrod/)

Our staff are working to replace the disk at present and data will be recovered from backups as soon as possible where this is required.


Further updates will be provided by future news item postings on the BADC website and RSS feed.


We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause in the meantime.
