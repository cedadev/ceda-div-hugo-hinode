Following an electrical fault at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory at 5am this morning the BADC webserver and services remain vulnerable while engineers work to address the problem. 

BADC staff will try to ensure that all services are returned to normal as soon as possible.

A new news item will be posted as soon as services are restored.


Apologies for the inconvenience and the late notice.
