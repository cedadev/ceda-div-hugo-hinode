The network through which the BADC site and services are served is currently experiencing issues which is causing pages and services on the BADC site to time out. 



The problem is currently being investigated and we hope to have services returned to normal as soon as possible.



A news item will be posted once normal service has been resumes. Please subscribe to the BADC news feed for further updates.




Many apologies for the inconvenience.
