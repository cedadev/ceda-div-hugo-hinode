- [FAAM - NEON](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/neon/)

- [FAAM - Production of Ozone of South-east England (POSE)](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/pose/)

- GOME - Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment

- [Met Office Land Surface Observation Stations Data](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/surface/) - **the MIDAS dataset is NOT affected**

Our staff are working to replace the disk at present and data will be recovered from backups as soon as possible.
