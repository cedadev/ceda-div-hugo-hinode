On Tuesday 1st December, a 10G Ethernet connection will be introduced into our servers room network, between 8:00 and 8:30am. We are told that the introduction should be fairly transparent and that users may not notice the short disruption in general. Our webserver is likely to be the most affected of our machines and so you may encounter temporary problems while browsing through our website. 


 
As always please let the [BADC Helpdesk](mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk) know if you experience any problems after this time or have any other queries.
