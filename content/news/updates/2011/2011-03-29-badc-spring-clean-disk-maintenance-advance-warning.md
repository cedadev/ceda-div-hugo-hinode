Following installation of improved air conditioning units within our server room BADC servers will be routinely taken down for required maintenance to ensure optimum operation. This is required to address some outstanding, non-critical issues as well as some additional disk issues that have recently developed.

During this period various datasets will be temporarily unavailable where an additional rapid fail-over copy is not available.

We will endeavour to keep users informed with additional news items on the BADC RSS feed. Please subscribe to the RSS feed using the link below.

We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.
