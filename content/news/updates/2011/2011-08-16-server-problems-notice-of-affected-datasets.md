Following system disk problems, the following datasets are temporarily unavailable:


* RAPID
* Met Office metDB
* Met Office land surface data (old dataset, now superseded by MIDAS dataset which is still available)


We are working at restoring access to the affected datasets as soon as possible.


We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.
