Issues with the disks holding the MetDB, Link and Met Office Surface station data (MIDAS data are not affected) require that these disks are taken down for maintenance. These disks will be taken down this morning (Tuesday 29th March). At present we do not have a resolution time, but we will issue a fresh news item once these data are re-instated into the archive.
