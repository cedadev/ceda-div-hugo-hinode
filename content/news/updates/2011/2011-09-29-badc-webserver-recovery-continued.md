The BADC team are continuing to restore services following an attack on our webserver. The NASA Ames file checker and BADC file name convention services are now back online. However, the following services are not currently operational:


* Trajectory service
* File uploader
* CEDA Visualisation service
* Search the BADC Website


We will restore these as soon as possible. Apologies for the inconvenience this is causing in the meantime.


Regards,


BADC/NEODC teamÂ
