The MIDAS data at the BADC is currently updated to December 2010. Unfortunately, we are experiencing difficulties extracting the 2011 data updates from the Met Office archive.
 In addition to this, we have learned that the order of elements in some of the MIDAS tables have been altered slightly which will result in a mismatch between the data files we currently hold and the future data updates.

 We are working on resuming routine MIDAS updates at the BADC as soon as possible. A News item will be posted when 2011 MIDAS data updates will be available from the BADC.

 We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause in the meantime.
