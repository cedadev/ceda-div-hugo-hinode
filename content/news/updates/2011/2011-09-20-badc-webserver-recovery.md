The BADC team are continuing to restore services following an attack on our webserver. However, the following services are not currently operational:

* Trajectory service
* File uploader
* CEDA Visualisation service

We will restore these as soon as possible. Apologies for the disruption this has caused.

Regards,

BADC/NEODC team
