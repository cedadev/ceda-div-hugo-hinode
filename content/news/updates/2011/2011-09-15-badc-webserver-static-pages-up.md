Following the attack on the BADC webserver over the weekend the BADC team have built a new secure web-server and are presently resurrecting the BADC website and services. At present just the static BADC pages are available and work is underway to systematically release all other parts of the BADC services once their security has been assured.


As parts of the service are returned to normal use fresh news items will be placed on the BADC website and on the BADC RSS feed.


BADC FTP service still operational: Access to the BADC archive is still available through the FTP server as this remains unaffected by the attack that affected the webserver.


The BADC apologies for the inconvenience that this is causing


In the meanwhile, should you have any questions or require assistance please feel free to contact the BADC helpdesk on badc@rl.ac.uk or 01235 446432.


Regards,


BADC/NEODC team
