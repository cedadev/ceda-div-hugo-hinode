We recently worked to improve the user experience of some of our most popular dataset collections from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia:


 


* [Climatic Research Unit (CRU) time-series datasets of variations in climate with variations in other phenomena](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3f8944800cc48e1cbc29a5ee12d8542d "CRU-TS dataset collection")
* [Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Year-by-Year Variation of Selected Climate Variables by CountrY (CY)](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/116aed45b5f0d15ddc3b0e753837e8c9 "CRU CY dataset collection")
* [CRUTEM datasets](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/eeabb5e1ff2140f48e76ea1ffda6bb48 "CRUTEM dataset collection")
* [Global maps of monthly self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) based on Climatic Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS) data](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/0ce9f24ff8719cced7f407694466c2ed "Global maps of monthly self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) based on Climatic Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS) data")

* We've reviewed and improved all the data catalogue entries for these dataset collections, making sure that they are up-to-date, correct and clearer than before.
* We've updated the access control to allow JASMIN and CEMS users to access these data locally
* We've produced a [tailored guide](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/WPS_CRU.html "How to extract CRU TS data using the CEDA WPS service") "CEDA WPS User Guide for extracting CRU TS data" explaining how to use this tool to sub-set from the CRU TS data collection
