An issue with PFS storage volumes is currently being investigated with the vendor but may be affecting access to the following storage volumes used by CEDA and JASMIN services:


* /gws/pw/j07 group workspaces
* /work/xfc transfer cache
* /work/scratch-pw[23] scratch volumes
* (/datacentre volumes used internally by the CEDA Archive)  
  
 We apologise for any inconvenience caused.
