Dear All,  
  
Services will be unsupported on Monday 28th and Tuesday 29th August due to the bank holiday site closure. Minimal staff will be working for the remainder of that week so responses to queries may take longer than usual.  
  
Normal support will resume from Monday 4th Sept.  
  
We apologise in advance for any inconveniences.

Have a good bank holiday weekend.

JASMIN & CEDA team
