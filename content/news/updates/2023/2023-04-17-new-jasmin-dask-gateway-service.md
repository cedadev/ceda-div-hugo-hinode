We have a new service which allows users to use the [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) parallel computing library more easily from the JASMIN notebook service, which is now available for users to beta test.

Dask allows easy parallelisation of many scientific python workloads, providing easy integration with commonly used python libraries such as numpy, xarray and pandas.

The JASMIN Dask-gateway service allows you to create a Dask cluster from the JASMIN notebook service, but allows the parallel workload to run in the LOTUS batch processing cluster.

If you would like to use this new service, please see the documentation here to get started: <https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-daskgateway>
