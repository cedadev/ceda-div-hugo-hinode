The Manchester Prize is a landmark AI-for-public-good scheme funded by the Government through which £1m in prizes will be awarded annually for the next ten years.

Participants must compete to develop the most innovative and impactful AI solution which demonstrates social benefit by overcoming challenges in the fields of energy, environment and infrastructure.

Experts from CEDA  will help participants find the most relevant data for their problem and connect with data providers to ensure they are using the data correctly. We are looking forward to learning more about how our data can be transformed and utilised in machine learning models.

10 teams who can successfully demonstrate how they can use artificial intelligence for public-good will receive around £100,000 of funding to continue developing their idea and the chance to win one million pounds.

Some example proposals could include:

- Reducing energy costs for consumers by using AI to model household energy use and identify targeted interventions, such as retrofitting and replacement
- Improving the response to extreme weather conditions by using AI and earth observation data to predict areas vulnerable to flooding, or to support better real-time spatial data of events such as wildfires and flash floods
- Enhancing food security by using earth observation and soil data to monitor and improve farming productivity and crop yield

The submission deadline is the 1st of February 2024.
