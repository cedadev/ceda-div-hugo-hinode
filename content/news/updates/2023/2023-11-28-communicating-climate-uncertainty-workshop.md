You are invited to a workshop on Uncertainty, delving into the crucial dialogue surrounding how users and providers of climate information navigate uncertainties.

On November 30th CEDA staff will be running an online workshop with Climateurope2 on communicating climate uncertainty.  The workshop will discuss how users of climate information deal with uncertainties and how providers of climate services should communicate about uncertainties in ways that enable users to extract the information they need. The workshop is intended for anyone involved in the practice of climate services, dealing with communicating uncertainties or simply interested in this topic.

- Andreas Hafver from DNV who will be giving a risk analysis perspective
- Christopher Jack from the Red Cross Red Crescent who will be talking about decision making on different timescales to support humanitarian interventions

This event is tailored for #ClimateService practitioners, communication enthusiasts, and anyone intrigued by the intricate world of climate uncertainty.
