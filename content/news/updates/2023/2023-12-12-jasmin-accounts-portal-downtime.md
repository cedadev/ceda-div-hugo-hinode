Dear Users,

The JASMIN accounts portal will be unavailable for a short period this Thursday afternoon (14/12/23), and should be considered 'at risk' from 14:00 until the end of the day.

The portal's database is being moved to a new database server and this will require a short downtime while the database is copied.

During this time users will be unable to create new accounts, change their SSH keys or apply for access to services.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.

JASMIN Team
