Dear User, 


  
As many users of the tape systems will know, we have recently experienced problems with the NLA, ET and JDMA services.


We resolved the problems with NLA and returned it to service on the 9th May 2023.


We had more problems with ET and JDMA, largely relating to problems with the Panasas storage used for intermediate storage internal to the service.  These were resolved and ET and JDMA were returned to a limited service on the 23rd May 2023.  This has been a success and we are now ready to return ET and JDMA to full service.


We thank our users for their patience during these outages.  
  



However, the tape system will be undergoing upgrade work in the week of 5th June to 9th June.  The tape system will be unavailable from the afternoon of 1st June.  This will affect ET, JDMA and NLA.


We apologise for the inconvenience and recognise that this will further impact user’s workflow.  
  



JASMIN Team
