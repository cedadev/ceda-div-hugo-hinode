The conference programme is available {{< link "/events/jasmin-conference-2023" >}}here{{< /link >}}.

Within the conference sessions we intend to include a selection of presentations from users that cover the technical perspective on how JASMIN has enabled their research. These will be complemented by some post-conference on-line webinars from users which cover the scientific details of the work that JASMIN enables. The registration form provides the opportunity to express your interest in contributing either a technical or a scientific focussed talk.
Itâ€™s been a long time since we last ran an in-person conference. Lots has changed with JASMIN and within the user community since then. Now is the perfect time to get everyone together again, share recent experiences, updates and changes, whilst strengthening the user community and discussing the future.
We look forward to receiving your contributions and will be delighted to meet you at the conference.

Don't forget registrations are also open for the {{< link "/events/introduction-scientific-computing/" >}}NCAS Intro to Scientific Computing course{{< /link >}}.
