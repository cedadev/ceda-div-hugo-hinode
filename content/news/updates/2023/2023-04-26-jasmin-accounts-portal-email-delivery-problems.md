Dear JASMIN Users  
  



The JASMIN accounts portal is currently having trouble delivering emails to users.


This means that login verification codes from the accounts portal are not being sent at the moment.  
  



We apologise for any inconvenience, and are working to fix the problem as soon as we can.  
  



JASMIN Team
