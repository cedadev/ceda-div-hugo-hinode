As announced recently, the current Globus endpoint on JASMIN is changing, and the old one will cease operating soon. The final day of operation for that endpoint is now confirmed as 18 December 2023.

We have been working hard to prepare a replacement, which is now in place. Please note that the Globus terminology has now changed, so users now interact with a Collection. Hence, please find below details of the new "JASMIN Default Collection" on Globus.

If you rely on Globus transfers to/from JASMIN in any automated processes, you are strongly recommended to try out the new Collection as soon as possible, to ensure continuity. The authentication method is a little different but still uses your JASMIN Accounts Portal credentials.

NB: Users of SSH-based or certificate-based gridftp using the `globus-url-copy` command (rather than the Globus online service) are **NOT** affected by this change: the current gridftp server will continue to work for the time being, but without the old Globus endpoint as an interface to it.

Please let us know at support@jasmin.ac.uk if you have any feedback about the new Collection and we will try to address any issues that may arise.

JASMIN Team.
