Apologies for any inconvenience.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are currently investigating issues with login server `login2.jasmin.ac.uk` which is therefore temporarily out of service. If you are able to use one of the alternative login servers [listed here](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/191-login-servers) for the time being, please do so, but some users may not be able to connect at present: we hope to have further updates on this issue as soon as possible.
  
Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
