Dear Jasmin user,  
  
The issue with PFS storage reported earlier is also affecting the batch cluster LOTUS. Batch jobs are timing out and many compute nodes going into a drain state. Please note that we are going to have to stop new LOTUS jobs running temporarily.  
  
We apologise for the disruption caused by the storage issues but are working to understand and resolve them as soon as possible.  
  
JASMIN Team.
