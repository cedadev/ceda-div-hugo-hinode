Please note the following JASMIN service updates for your attention:



1. **nx-login service update**


The servers nx-login[123].jasmin.ac.uk will be rebooted tomorrow Wed 3 May between 08:30 - 09:30 to apply new licenses. This will result in the interruption to desktop sessions, so please log out of your NX desktop session by the end of today to avoid disruption.


The new license will enable us to add an additional server in due course to the existing 3, which will help ease the load on the existing servers.



2. **tape services status**


ET, JDMA and NLA services have been affected by a problem with the NLA and underlying StorageD service since Friday evening (initially it had been thought that they were unaffected). The problem is now understood, but all services are currently unavailable. Testing is currently underway which should enable ET and JDMA to resume, but NLA is anticipated to take longer to resume service.  
Please look out for further announcements.



With apologies for any inconvenience.


JASMIN Team
