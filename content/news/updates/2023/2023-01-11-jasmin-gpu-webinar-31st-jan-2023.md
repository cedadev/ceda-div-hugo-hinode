Dear JASMIN user,  
  



We will be hosting a webinar on Tuesday 31st January 2023 at 10:30 about JASMIN’s new GPU cluster, ORCHID. The event will provide information about ORCHID itself, as well as hearing from recent test users about their experiences with it. Users of other research GPU clusters will also talk about their use cases and experience.  
  



The webinar is open to all JASMIN users, but will be of particular interest to those embarking on research involving machine learning techniques, or who have been seeking GPU resources for use in their work.  
  



Please save the date!   
  



Agenda and zoom link will follow in due course  
  



Regards,   
JASMIN team
