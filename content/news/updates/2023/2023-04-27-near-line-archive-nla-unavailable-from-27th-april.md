Dear Users

Due to problems arising from the JASMIN maintenance day on Tuesday 25th April, the Near-line Archive (NLA) remains unavailable.  We are working hard to remedy this, but it is likely that the NLA will not be available until after the bank holiday weekend, 2nd May at the earliest.

This affects just the NLA service, other tape services (JDMA and ET) are unaffected.  We apologise for the inconvenience.

JASMIN Team
