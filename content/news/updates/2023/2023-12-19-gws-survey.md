**GWS Managers:** Please take a few minutes to complete our **survey of Group Workspaces on JASMIN**.

We are initiating this survey to examine the utilization of JASMIN group workspaces (GWSs). Storage is an expensive resource at the scale used within JASMIN and consumes significant energy. Your involvement is pivotal in helping us to understand how it is currently being used and how that could be improved.
As a GWS manager you may be managing more than one GWS. In such a case please complete a separate survey for each GWS that you are responsible for. Conversely, if several of you are responsible for one workspace, please coordinate with each other to submit one response per workspace.

Further information and instructions are provided at the survey link above.

Your contribution will help us gain valuable insights into the usage of group workspace on JASMIN.
We plan to hold a webinar event in February 2024 to build further activities arising from this survey, so please watch this space.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation,

JASMIN Team
