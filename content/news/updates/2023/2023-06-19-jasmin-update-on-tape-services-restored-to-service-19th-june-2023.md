We are happy to announce that all tape services are now available.


The NLA, ET and JDMA services are again available and ready for users to submit requests after a period of extensive testing last week.


This follows a major update to the underlying tape system, undertaken by Scientific Computing Department staff, who we thank for their hard work.


We thank JASMIN users for their patience over the past two weeks and apologise for the inconvenience.  We also recognise that there has been an impact on user’s workflows.
