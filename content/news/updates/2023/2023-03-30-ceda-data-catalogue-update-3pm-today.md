The CEDA Data Catalogue service (<https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk> ) will be briefly off line at 3pm today to allow a number of updates to the service to be rolled out. This may lead to a period of time in which the catalogue search needs to be rebuilt to help refine the search service. The main user improvement will be with the search interface with increased search options and better search results and the ability to search within related records. Additionally, the Dataset records will, in most cases, be additionally augmented with project funder and PI information where available on attached Project records to provide a richer set of metadata for each dataset. Dataset total number of files and volume details will also be displayed on dataset records for all CEDA hosted content.  
  
Other catalogue improvements will aid the harvesting and external exposure of our dataset holdings within services such as the Google Dataset Search service as well as internal CEDA workflows for catalogue content maintenance.
