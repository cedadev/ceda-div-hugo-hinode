We wish to make you aware that industrial action is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 10 May 2023. We expect services to continue to operate, but running “at risk” at reduced (in some cases substantially) staffing levels. Our ability to respond to faults and requests will be reduced, leading to delays to our response in some circumstances.  
  
Thank you in advance for your understanding.
