1. Interruption to tape services:  
The tape library is currently out of service due to essential maintenance work. It had been hoped that the work involved could be carried out without an interruption to users but unfortunately this is now not the case: apologies for the short notice. This affects Elastic Tape, JDMA, and Near-Line Archive (NLA) services.  
  
2. Update in storage issues:  
Further to yesterdayâ€™s issues with some storage volumes, a related issue has occurred again today but is being dealt with.Users may observe a brief unavailability of some GWS volumes, please be patient for a few minutes and they should become accessible again.


 


With apologies for any inconvenience. 


JASMIN Team.
