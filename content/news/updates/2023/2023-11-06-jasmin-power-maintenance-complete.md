All systems are now reported to be operating normally, so JASMIN and CEDA services can be considered back to normal and the recent power maintenance work considered **complete**.Any problems should now be reported to the relevant helpdesk (`support@ceda.ac.uk` for CEDA Archive services, `support@jasmin.ac.uk` for JASMIN services).

Please note the following additional points however:

- {{<link "status">}}Status page{{</link>}}: our new status page is updated regularly with current and future incidents and their status. This will be used from now on for status updates on JASMIN and CEDA services, so please bookmark this page and use it to check on services before reporting faults to the helpdesk.
- Parts of the JASMIN network remain **"at risk"** until the pre-existing issue with switches is resolved.
- Cloud tenancy managers should note that **they need to power on all their own machines**, including the machines in CaaS clusters. Once powered on, clusters should be functional, if not, the advice is to try patching the cluster. After this, if clusters still arenâ€™t functioning after this, please contact support.
- The **JASMIN Globus endpoint** is due to be replaced by a new version before mid-December. Please look out for further announcements if you use Globus to transfer data to/from JASMIN.

We thank you for your patience and understanding during this essential maintenance work.
