The CEDA Catalogue Service will be temporarily off line Friday 8th September 10:00-10:30 to allow for a service update to be rolled out. This will provide some additional layout improvements to the new search tool and also add in external dataset citation listings for DOIed datasets.

We anticipate that the catalogue update will complete quickly, thought the index underpinning the search may take some additional time to update.
