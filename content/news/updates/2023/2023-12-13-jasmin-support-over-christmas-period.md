Dear JASMIN users,

This message includes information about the JASMIN support over the Christmas period and important updates on JASMIN services:

- JASMIN support over the Christmas period
- Closure period schedule
- LOTUS throughput/capacity reduction
- Maintenance work planned for Tuesday 16th January 2024
- New jasmin-community discussion forum

##### JASMIN support over the Christmas period:

As we approach the Christmas period, please be aware of the limited support arrangements in place which will result in CEDA and JASMIN services running “at-risk”.
While the shutdown of CEDA’s host organisation, STFC, runs from 15:00 on Friday 22nd December 2022 to 09:00 on Tuesday 2nd January 2024, a reduced number of staff remain at work from Friday 15th December, so we are unable to offer a normal helpdesk service between those dates.

CEDA and JASMIN services should therefore be considered to be running “at-risk” from 17:00 on Friday 15th December to 9:00 on Tuesday 2nd January 2024, with little or no helpdesk service available during this period.
A “change freeze” is also in place as of 17:00 on Thursday 14th December, so requests for new or changes to existing services will not be dealt with until the New Year.

CEDA websites, archives and services, including access to JASMIN, should be available during this period but will operate unsupported. Should any problems occur to our services, it is unlikely that these would be fixed until staff return in the New Year.

Emergency cover for site services (for issues such as fire or power outage) remains in place during the site shutdown period. Although we anticipate that the JASMIN infrastructure will remain operational throughout, it is possible that some issues may not receive attention until staff return in the New Year.  

All user queries received during this period will be answered as soon as possible from Tuesday 2nd January 2024.

#### Closure period schedule:

__Thursday 14th December 2023 - 17:00__

- change freeze starts
- limited helpdesk support available

__Friday 22nd December 2023__

- site closure at 15:00 GMT
- services unsupported.

__Tuesday 2nd January 2024__

- site reopens
- normal service resumes

The CEDA and JASMIN teams would like to take this opportunity to wish all our users a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

##### LOTUS throughput/capacity will be reduced while the network switch work is carried out.

By a gradual rack-draining, compute nodes per rack will be in “maint” state when viewed in SLURM node information e.g. sinfo

##### Scheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 16th January - 2024

This will cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services. Systems will be “at risk” and may be unavailable for all or part of the day. Other system work is also scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption.
The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 05:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.

##### New community discussion forum:

If you have useful tips or topics for discussion, feel free to contribute to the discussions taking shape over at our new "jasmin-community" area here: (you'll need a Github account to post)
https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-community/discussions

For support enquiries, please continue to contact the helpdesk at support@jasmin.ac.uk

Thank you for your attention and please look out for further updates as this work progresses.  
JASMIN Team
