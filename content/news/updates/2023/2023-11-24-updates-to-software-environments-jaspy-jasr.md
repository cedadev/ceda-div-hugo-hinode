The following software environments **Jaspy** and **Jasr** will have new default versions at 9:00 am on Wednesday 13th December 2023:

- Jaspy: Python, and other, tools and libraries.
- Jasr: R tools and libraries.

The new version of Jaspy (jaspy/3.10/r20230718) and Jasr (jasr/4.2/r20230718) are already installed on the sci machines, but are not yet the default that is obtained when doing {{< command >}} module load jaspy {{< /command >}} or  {{< command >}} module load jasr {{< /command >}}

The previous Jaspy and Jasr releases will continue to be available if preferred, by loading the module with its full label e.g. {{< command >}} module load jaspy/3.10/r20220721 {{< /command >}}

Please note that the JASMIN Notebook Service will have the new version of Jaspy: jaspy/3.10/r20230718

The new release includes updates to a number of software packages as well as some new tools. The release, labelled as "jaspy/3.10/r20230718" is described on our Help Page at: https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs.

We advise you to plan your work accordingly to minimise the impact, but please accept our apologies in advance for any inconvenience.

Thank you for your attention.

Best wishes,
