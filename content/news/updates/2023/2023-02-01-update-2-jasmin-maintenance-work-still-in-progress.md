Dear users,  
  



Maintenance work is still in progress today.  
  



* Parallel File System (PFS) Storage
+ A second phase of the upgrade is now likely to be postponed to another date. PFS storage is running, but at reduced performance.  This affects some CEDA Archive services, group workspaces with /gws/pw/j07 paths, /work/xfc and /work/scratch-pw[2,3] volumes
+ The old /work/scratch-pw volume should no longer be used and will be physically removed shortly.

* LOTUS batch processing cluster: a reservation will remain in place until later today. An announcement will be made when this is lifted.


In summary: while many systems are back in operation, there is more work to be completed so in order to avoid disruption to their work, users are advised to avoid resuming work on the system until further notice.  
  



NB: as part of the changes introduced yesterday, access to storage volumes other than /home/users from login servers is now removed. This is in line with documentation and training materials but some login servers intermittently allowed this. Please refer to documentation about [access to storage](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/176-storage) and [login servers](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/191-login-servers) for further information.


  
Please look out for further updates today. 


With apologies for any inconvenience caused,  
  



JASMIN Team
