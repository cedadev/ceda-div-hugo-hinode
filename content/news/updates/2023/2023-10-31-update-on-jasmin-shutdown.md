The electrical maintenance work over the weekend was completed successfully but JASMIN services are not yet available to users.

The infrastructure team is now working through the carefully-planned sequence of restarting and checking subsystems before making the services that depend on them, available again.

Please await further notices here or on our {{< link "status" />}} page before attempting to use any services on JASMIN for the time being.

Thank you for your cooperation and patience,
JASMIN Team
