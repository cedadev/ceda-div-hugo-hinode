Dear Users,  
  



The email address from which the JASMIN accounts portal sends notifications to users, such as service expiry reminders, password resets and one-time passwords is changing from *no-reply@accounts.jasmin.ac.uk* to *noreply@jasmin.ac.uk**.*  
  



Please check your spam folder to make sure emails from the JASMIN accounts portal do not get lost, and if you have any inbox rules which handle incoming mail this will need to be updated.  
  



Thank you



JASMIN Team
