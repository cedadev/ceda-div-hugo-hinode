1. Interruption to tape services (including week of 16-20 Jan)  
The tape library is now functioning but with only one robot so performance is reduced. Please avoid using for now, as any jobs remaining over the weekend will likely need to be stopped ahead of scheduled maintenance due start on Monday 16th Jan for four days. Tape services should therefore be considered at reduced performance for now, but fully unavailable for most/all of next week. This affects Elastic Tape, JDMA, and Near-Line Archive (NLA) services.  
  
2. Update in storage issues:  
No further update at this stage: users may observe a brief unavailability of some GWS volumes, please be patient for a few minutes and they should become accessible again.  
  
With apologies for any inconvenience.   
JASMIN Team.
