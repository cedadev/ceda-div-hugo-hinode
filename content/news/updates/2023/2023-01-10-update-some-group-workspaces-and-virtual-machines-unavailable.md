Dear users,  
  
Further to our earlier message, issues with the affected storage volumes are currently being resolved. Some are now available again while the root cause is still being investigated.   
  
Some virtual machines including login and sci servers have also been affected by related issues, so may take a while to resume to normal service.   
  
Apologies for any inconvenience.   
  
JASMIN Team
