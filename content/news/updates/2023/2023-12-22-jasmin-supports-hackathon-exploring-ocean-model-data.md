###### JASMIN supported over 40 hackathon attendees to help improve their data analysis skills with high-resolution ocean data. The hackathon made use of the JASMIN notebook service, group workspace storage and processing simulations on the LOTUS batch processing cluster.

The {{< link href="https://eerie-project.eu/" >}} EERIE project {{< /link >}} is developing improved Earth system models, harnessing Europe’s pre-exascale computers and considering European ocean mesoscale eddies in preparation for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The project’s first General Assembly, held in Germany, saw 43 project members from 15 different project partners attend an extra two days for the project’s first hackathon. The aim of the hackathon was for participants to get to know each other while looking at some of the initial EERIE high-resolution eddy-resolving simulations and to gain experience using some relevant software tools.

Some of the data from the EERIE simulations were stored on JASMIN, other data were stored at {{< link href="https://www.dkrz.de/" >}} DKRZ {{< /link >}} in Germany. Using JASMIN and DKRZ’s Jupyter Notebook services, everyone at the hackathon had a similar interface to the data irrespective of which dataset they were using or where they were working. Everyone made great progress in just two days, learning many new skills and generating some promising initial results for the project. JASMIN staff were available to help provide any support needed and everyone was able to access and use JASMIN successfully during the event.

If you have an idea for a training event or hackathon that could benefit from access to JASMIN {{< link href="https://jasmin.ac.uk/help/contact/" >}} please get in touch. {{< /link >}} We have the ability to provide JASMIN training accounts which can be “borrowed” for your own training event and configured for your needs. {{< link  href="https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4996-jasmin-training-accounts">}} Further details can be found here. {{< /link >}}
