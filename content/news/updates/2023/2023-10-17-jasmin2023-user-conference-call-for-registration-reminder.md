Dear JASMIN user,


As previously announced, we will be hosting the next JASMIN conference at our host institution, RAL, on the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire. It will occur over two half days on the afternoon of Wednesday 1st November  and the morning of Thursday 2nd of November 2023. 


Call for [Registration is now open](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/jasmin2023-user-conference-tickets-721151001057) and  the conference programme is available [here](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/agenda/jasmin-conference-2023/detail/).  


Within the conference sessions we intend to include a selection of presentations from users that cover the technical perspective on how JASMIN has enabled their research. These will be complemented by some post-conference on-line webinars from users which cover the scientific details of the work that JASMIN enables. **The registration form provides the opportunity to express your interest in contributing either a technical or a scientific focused talk.**  
  



**Note:** Deadline for a technical talk contribution is **Monday 20th of October!**  
  



It’s been a long time since we last ran an in-person conference. Lots has changed with JASMIN and within the user community since then. Now is the perfect time to get everyone together again, share recent experiences, updates and changes, whilst strengthening the user community and discussing the future.  
  



We look forward to receiving your contributions and will be delighted to meet you at the conference. 


The JASMIN team
