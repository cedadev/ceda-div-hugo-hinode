Dear Users,

As per our [previous announcement in July](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/advance-notice-of-jasmin-power-maintenance-autumn-2023/), essential work will be taking place this Autumn in the data centre (machine room) where JASMIN is hosted to carry out safety checks and 5-yearly recertification of power supply equipment.

All options have been explored by STFC (JASMIN’s host organisation) to minimise the possible impact on users, but despite this, **it is likely that JASMIN will be unavailable for a period of up to 2 weeks**, hence this early warning. This would affect **ALL CEDA and JASMIN services**, including:

* CEDA Archive and services
* JASMIN interactive and batch compute. LOTUS queues will need to be fully closed and drained.
* JASMIN Cloud tenancies
* Any services operated by third parties us which depend on either the JASMIN Cloud or the gws-access services.

We are working with STFC’s Digital Infrastructure group to develop plans for this unavoidable intervention which will ensure that the work is carried out in the least disruptive way possible, including scheduling other maintenance work during the same period.

The current outline timetable for the work is as follows:

* **w/c 16 October**: Normal service, but draining of LOTUS queues may mean queues are closed towards end of week (timing TBC)
* **w/c 23 October**: Assume all services “at risk” from Monday. No LOTUS jobs will be allowed to be queued or executed, and some services may be subject to maintenance/pre-shutdown checks. JASMIN services should be considered entirely offline from Wednesday 25th October, as we start to shutdown storage and host services.
* **weekend of 28/29**: October: full downtime
* **w/c 30 October**: We will begin the process of bringing services back up, but additional scheduled maintenance will be completed before services are made available to users. Some services including the JASMIN cloud may remain offline for most of this week. We will attempt to restore service when possible, subject to the maintenance described above. Updates will be provided via the usual channels about service restoration/availability.

Please look out for further notices about this in the coming weeks.

With apologies for any inconvenience caused,

JASMIN Team
