A connectivity issue has affected many CEDA and JASMIN services over the past 24 hrs. While affected services should now be available to users again, the issue has so far been attributed to a faulty network switch. A temporary fix is in place but until the faulty switch can be removed/replaced (timescale TBC), services should be considered “at risk”.  
With apologies for any inconvenience.
