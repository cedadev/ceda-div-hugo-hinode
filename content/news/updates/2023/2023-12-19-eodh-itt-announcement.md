NCEO and the EO DataHub team are pleased to announce the release of our latest invitation to tender, the EO DataHub Applications and Integrations ITT. The tender is now open for submissions and will close on the 19th of January at 14:00: 

https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/037204-2023 

The total value across all lots in the ITT is £1.8 million including VAT.  

Note that it is important to read the whole of this message including the notice for clarification at the end. 

The EO Data Hub is a pathfinder service designed to offer UK users a step-change in data access and quality serving commercial users, government, researchers and students. This ITT will deliver three specific solutions that make use of the Hub Platform as their back-end service layer, deliver beneficial services to significant groups of users and align with UK strategic objectives and activities at the national scale.  The current ITT’s implementation will mark an important step forward in adding user-orientated service interfaces to the core Hub Platform software (which is now in progress through an earlier ITT). 

The three applications are defined in separate Lots, each of which has a specific focus and may be bid for individually:    

**Lot 1:** Web-application delivering Combined Information from Climate Observations and Projections;  

**Lot 2:** Web-map application showcasing Land Surface data provided through the EODH: responsive and fast "slippy-map" application providing browse, select, compare, visualise and processing capabilities;    

**Lot 3:** Open-source code integrations and training: accelerating use of the Hub Platform capabilities, with a focus on GIS practitioners, through firstly a software integration with an existing platform or software product and secondly a training course delivered through a collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks.
