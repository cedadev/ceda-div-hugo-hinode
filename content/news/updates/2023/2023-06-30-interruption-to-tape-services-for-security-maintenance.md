Further to our earlier announcement, tape services will need a separate interruption to apply security updates. Tape services will not be available between midday on Monday 3rd July until the work has completed, hopefully later on Tuesday 4th July.  
This affects Elastic Tape, JDMA and Near-Line Archive services.  
  
With apologies for the short notice and any inconvenience caused
