Part of the JASMIN network suffered a failure yesterday evening and the team is currently working to resolve this. As a result, many JASMIN and CEDA services are currently unavailable.

This is believed to be a recurrence of a hardware-related issue that occurred a few weeks ago. It had been temporarily resolved but the possibility of further breaks remained. A further intervention is required (to be scheduled in due course) but the risk of further interruptions does remain until this has been done.

Please look out for further announcements.

Apologies for any inconvenience.

JASMIN Team
