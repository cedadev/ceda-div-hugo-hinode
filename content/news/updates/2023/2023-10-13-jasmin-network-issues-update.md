Dear users


 


The network issue earlier this week has had a temporary solution applied but the underlying issue remains and as a result the system still remains at risk. Further work between now and the scheduled down at the end of October will look at the best available options to resolve it.


 


We are still making preparations for the scheduled down time, but the [timetable remains as per our last announcement](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/reminder-advance-notice-of-jasmin-power-maintenance-autumn-2023/). Please note that a LOTUS batch cluster reservation for 25th October will start to have an effect from 18th October onwards for users scheduling longer-running jobs: please plan your work accordingly.


 


With apologies for any inconvenience,


JASMIN Team
