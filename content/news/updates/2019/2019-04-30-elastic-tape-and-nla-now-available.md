The upgrades to the CASTOR DB have gone well and so systems are now available again. However, ET users are reminded that there is still a possibility of as yet undiscovered problems appearing, and so they should not delete data from disc until after a further message is issued saying that things are all verified as working.   
It is hoped to send this message early tomorrow.


Many thanks for your patience
