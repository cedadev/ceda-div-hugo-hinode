There have been some issues with the JASMIN storage cluster which have created problems effecting access to some Group Workspaces and causing JASMIN and CEMS to hang.


These issues have now been fixed and everything should be back up and running as normal.


Once again we are sorry for the inconvenience this has caused and thank you for your co-operation.


Please let us know if there are any further problems with volumes hanging or any other issues encountered.
