Yesterday’s JASMIN maintenance went well and the work has now been completed. All services are back to normal - please let us know if you don’t think this is the case.


As part of the maintenance work, we have introduced a new LOTUS queue called ‘test’. This queue can be used to test new workflows and also to help new users to familiarise themselves with the LSF batch system and LOTUS. Both serial and parallel codes can be tested on the queue ‘test’.


Further details on the queue ‘test’ can be found here: <https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/274-lotus-queues>


Thank you for your patience during the maintenance work.


JASMIN team
