This is just a reminder that further scheduled maintenance is required onÂ Wednesday 27th November to supplement the work recently undertaken on 14th October. The work this time will focus mainly on the Panasas system, used for parallel file system (PFS) storage.


All volumes which use PFS storage should be considered unavailable for the duration of this work. Although this does not affect all areas of JASMIN, it is likely that this will cause some disruption to services and user processes, so you may wish to plan your work to avoid this period.


The extent of affected services includes but is not limited to:


/work/scratch  
LOTUS batch processing cluster (because of dependency on /work/scratch)  
/group\_workspaces/jasmin2  
Parts of the CEDA Archive residing on PFS storage  
Other services which depend on PFS storage for their operation


During the same period, maintenance is also scheduled on the PURE storage used for home directories, SMF volumes and /work/scratch-nompiio. However, the PURE maintenance is expected to be transparent to users, although some element of risk remains.


The JASMIN Community Cloud should be unaffected by all of the above.


We apologise for the inconvenience which this interruption will cause.


JASMIN Team
