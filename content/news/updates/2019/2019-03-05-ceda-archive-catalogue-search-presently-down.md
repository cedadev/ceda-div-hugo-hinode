Users of the data catalogue may be aware that the data catalogue search is presently unable to display any results. This also appears to affect some record listings on catalogue pages.


We are presently investigating the cause of this issue and hope to resolve it as soon as possible.


Apologies for any inconvenience that this may cause in the meanwhile.


CEDA team
