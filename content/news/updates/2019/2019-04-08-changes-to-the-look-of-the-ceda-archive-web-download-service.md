We are updating the CEDA archive download service found in this link: http://data.ceda.ac.uk/


It has very similar functionality to the previous version but if you encounter any problems, please let us know.


If you were using this via an opendap script, then the URL will change to: http://dap.ceda.ac.uk/thredds/fileServer/
