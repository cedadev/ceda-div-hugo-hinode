The UKRI Cloud Workshop is being held on the 12th February at the Francis Crick Institute in central London.


The event provides an opportunity for the members of the UK research community to meet and find out more about how they can make use of cloud computing with their research or share experiences and best practice with existing applications that run on cloud.


There will be presentations from a wide range of disciplines, with representatives from major research centres, national and international research collaborations and public cloud vendors.


There is also an opportunity to submit an abstract for a presentation, lightning talk, a session proposal or run a demo.


The deadline for abstract submissions is Friday 11th January. Cloud Working Group will review the submissions and confirm the programme by 14th January.


Registration will close on 5th February, more details can be found here: <http://bit.ly/register-ukri-cloud-workshop-2019>Â
