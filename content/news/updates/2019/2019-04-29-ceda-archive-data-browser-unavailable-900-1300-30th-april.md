The CEDA Archive data browser (data.ceda.ac.uk) will be unavailable tomorrow morning (30th April) due to an upgrade. We hope that service will be back to normal from 1pm, however they should be considered at risk all day.


The main changes will be visual but there are some functional differences. The key being if you were using the data browser via an opendap script; you will need to change the URL to: http://dap.ceda.ac.uk/thredds/fileServer/


These updates will improve the look and feel of our websites, enabling a better user experience. It has very similar functionality to the previous version but if you encounter any problems, please let us know via the [helpdesk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk).


We apologise for any inconvenience caused.Â
