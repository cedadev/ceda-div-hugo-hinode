-----------------------------------


We are currently experiencing some issues with the following CEDA Archive service:  
[dap.ceda.ac.uk](http://dap.ceda.ac.uk/)


This will be causing some issues when you try to download data. You can still access and download data via FTP.


See details about this here: <https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/99-download-data-from-ceda-archives>


We are working on resolving these issues and will update progress on here ASAP.


Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
