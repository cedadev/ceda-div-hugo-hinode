Earlier this year the Met Office released the “[MIDAS Open](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/dbd451271eb04662beade68da43546e1)” dataset, a publically available version of the popular, but restricted, Met Office Integrated Data Archive System ([MIDAS](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/220a65615218d5c9cc9e4785a3234bd0)) Land and Marine Surface Stations dataset. Thanks to the efforts of the MIDAS Open team at the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) we’ve now published an updated version of MIDAS Open, bringing in new data for 2018 and updates for some existing years too. Though aimed at being of interest to everyone, we anticipate these [new data](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=v201908&sort_by=relevance&results_per_page=20) will be particularly useful for service providers or members of the public who have previously been unable to use the restricted MIDAS dataset.


[This release](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=v201908&sort_by=relevance&results_per_page=20) (version 201908) includes data from 2018 and amendments to the previous release (version 201901). To help users identify the changes, a series of ‘change logs’ have been produced for each dataset which include:


* An overall summary file for each dataset giving the number and lists of new, removed and updated files (example [here](http://dap.ceda.ac.uk/thredds/fileServer/badc/ukmo-midas-open/data/uk-hourly-weather-obs/dataset-version-201908/midas-open_uk-hourly-weather-obs_dv-201908_change_log.txt))
* Details of each line where changes have occurred from the previous release (example [here](http://dap.ceda.ac.uk/thredds/fileServer/badc/ukmo-midas-open/data/uk-hourly-weather-obs/dataset-version-201908/change_log_station_files/midas-open_uk-hourly-weather-obs_dv-201908_aberdeenshire_00147_braemar_qcv-1_1914.txt)), providing full traceability of alterations made.


MIDAS Open comprises of hourly and daily weather measurements and observations of parameters relating to temperature, rainfall, sunshine, radiation, wind and weather observations such as present weather codes, cloud cover, snow etc. The data have been released under the [UK’s Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) and formatted in spreadsheet-friendly [BADC-CSV format](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/105-badc-csv). 


Though the MIDAS Open data are freely available for all users with a free CEDA user account, we would be delighted to hear more about your use of these data. Knowing about the types of work that these open data support helps us to gather evidence of the impact our data and services have.
