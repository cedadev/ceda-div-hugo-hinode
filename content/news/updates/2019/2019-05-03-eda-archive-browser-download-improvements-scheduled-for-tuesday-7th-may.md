We will be performing a planned upgrade to our download, OPeNDAP and archive browsing services. This will allow images and text to be displayed in the browser, rather than downloaded.


Users may experience problems with using the service between 9:30 and 10:30 on Tuesday (part of our usual at-risk period) as data.ceda.ac.uk and dap.ceda.ac.uk are updated.
