The link between the JASMIN Unmanaged Cloud and the JASMIN Data Transfer Zone will be upgraded from 2x10Gb to 2x40Gb during the 14th August.


This should be a transparent change with no disruption - however, if there are issues, both services could be inaccessible for up to one hour.


Apologies for any inconvenience caused.


The JASMIN Team
