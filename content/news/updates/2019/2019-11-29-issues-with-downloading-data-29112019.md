We are currently experiencing difficulties with [www.dap.ceda.ac.uk](http://www.dap.ceda.ac.uk) - this is a service that allows web downloads from the CEDA Archive data browser ([www.data.ceda.ac.uk](http://www.data.ceda.ac.uk)).   
  
The service is experiencing some issues which means that data downloads are timing out. However it is an intermittent fault and therefore difficult to diagnose the cause. We are working on this.   
  
Apologies for any inconvenience caused in the meantime.
