The CEDA team have now restored the vast majority of datasets affected by the error that caused data to be mistakenly deleted. All priority datasets have now been restored. A small number of datasets are still awaiting restoration due to needing additional storage space - we are working on this and anticipate these datasets to be fully restored in the next few weeks. We still foresee a few problems, so [please tell us](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk) if you spot anything.


We have learnt several important lessons from this experience: 


* Our back ups work! Although the process has taken a little longer than we first estimated, the action of restoring data from back ups has been successful.
* Some internal processes need to change. We need to tighten up the way we add/delete data from the archive to make sure all files are counted in and out properly.
* Risky bulk operations, like data migration, need more time and effort to lower the risks.


Thank you for your patience whilst we have worked to resolve this issue.
