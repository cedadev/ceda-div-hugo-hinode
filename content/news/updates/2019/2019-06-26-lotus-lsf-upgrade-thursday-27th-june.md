As previously announced, the LSF job management system used for JASMIN's LOTUS batch processing cluster, will be upgraded tomorrow (Thursday 27th June) with LOTUS unavailable for the whole day. This involves migrating the LSF master to new hardware and upgrading the LSF software version. Queues will be closed as of the evening of Wednesday 26th June after which it will not be possible to submit new jobs until after the work has completed.


Please note that this means that jobs submitted with a run time that goes beyond midnight tonight (Wednesday 26th June) will not start running until after the work has completed.


Apologies for any inconvenience.


JASMIN Team
