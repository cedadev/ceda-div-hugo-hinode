Scheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 15th October, which will result in many systems, services and data (including parts of the CEDA Archive) being unavailable for much of the day. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.  
  
The following work is currently scheduled for this date:


* Quarterly patching and rebooting of servers to apply important updates
* Application of updates to Panasas storage system
* Purging of data older than 90 days from /work/scratch area


  
Please be aware that further purging of scratch areas will be carried out at regular intervals to ensure availability of scratch space for all users. Where possible, this would be scheduled to coincide with maintenance days such as this.  
  
The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. The reservation will start at 06:00 on 15th October, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.  
  
Please look out for further announcements nearer the date, but you may wish to plan your work on JASMIN to avoid this date.
