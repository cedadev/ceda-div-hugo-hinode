We are currently experiencing some problems with LOTUS capacity due to a power cut at the weekend. We expect LOTUS jobs may take a little longer to run until the problem has been resolved. We are working to fix this as soon as possible. Remedial work is underway and we expect it to be completed in the next few days, when services will resume as normal. 


Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
