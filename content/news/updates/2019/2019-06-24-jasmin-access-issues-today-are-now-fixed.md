Dear JASMIN users,


JASMIN access issues from this morning should now be fixed. We are still investigating some storage issues found in some GWSâ€™s.


If you experience any machines that are unresponsive/hanging please let us know by contacting support@ceda.ac.uk with specific details of the issue. You can find pointers for what to include in a helpdesk query here: https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4703-how-to-contact-us-about-jasmin-issues


Best wishes,  
JASMIN team
