#### CEDA and JASMIN services will be unsupported on Monday 26th and Tuesday 27th August due to the UK summer bank holiday. No helpdesk queries or services will be  answered or fixed on these dates.


We also anticipate staff availability to be reduced in the surrounding weeks. Therefore, service issues or user support queries may take longer than usual to be resolved at this time. 


We are a small team and the holidays put us under added pressure. We may not be as responsive as usual between 19-30th August. Please bear with us during this period, we will do our best to provide appropriate support when we can! 


Note that our normal support hours are as follows: 


Monday - Thursday: 9am-5pm; 


Friday: 9am-4.30pm 


(UK, excluding Bank Holidays)


Thank you for your understanding,  


CEDA and JASMIN team
