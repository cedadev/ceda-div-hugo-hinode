Elastic Tape, JDMA, and NLA not available - from 16:00 today (26th November) and should be considered at risk until the end of Thursday 28th November. 


The databases underlying these systems are being migrated to improved hardware during this period. Ingestion will be suspended and resumed once the systems are back, but retrievals will be terminated to alllow the DBs to be consistent during the migration.


The systems should be restored by 1600 on Wednesday 27th, but there is a small chance of an overrun. Once back, the systems will be monitored to ensure they behave correctly in the new environment. This means that the system will be "at risk" on Thursday 28th.


Thank you for your patience during this exercise.
