Yesterday (17 April), we intended to upgrade the JASMIN OpenStack Cloud from the current Mitaka-based release to the most recent Queens-based release. However, we were unable to fully complete the upgrade.


We intend to resume the upgrade on Tuesday 23 April.


The upgrade is a three part process:


1. Upgrade to the Ocata-based release
2. Upgrade the networking manager
3. Upgrade to the Queens-based release


Due to its complexity, the first part of the upgrade took more time to complete and test than expected. With the long Easter weekend approaching, we took the decision to pause the upgrade rather than risk leaving VMs inaccessible over the long weekend. We will resume the upgrade on Tuesday 23 April.


Currently, guest VMs are fully functional. When the upgrade is resumed on 23 April there will be some intermittent connectivity issues, but the VMs themselves should be unaffected.


While the JASMIN Cloud Portal and OpenStack API are functional, we have decided to keep them in maintenance mode until the upgrade is complete, and we are again confident that the JASMIN Cloud is ready for public use.


We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your patience during this important maintenance.


Many thanks,


The JASMIN Team
