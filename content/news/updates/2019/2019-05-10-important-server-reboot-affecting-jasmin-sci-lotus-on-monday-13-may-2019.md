Dear JASMIN users,


We urgently need to reboot the server that hosts   
the volume ‘/apps’ and `/apps/contrib’   
on Monday 13th May 2019 at 9:00am.   
Large numbers of JASMIN servers (scientific servers, LOTUS)  
will be briefly unavailable for approximately an hour.


Please make sure that all your running jobs on LOTUS   
ARE COMPLETED BY 7AM on MONDAY 13-May-2019 as   
the LSF system reservation is not set up.


  
We apologise for the short notice.


CEDA and JASMIN Team
