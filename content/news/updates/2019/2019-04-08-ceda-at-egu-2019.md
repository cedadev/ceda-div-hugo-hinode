Three members of the CEDA team are attending this year’s European Geophysical Union General Assembly in Vienna. You can see the details of our submissions below.


The EGU General Assembly 2019, taking place in Vienna (Austria) on 7–12 April 2019, will bring together geoscientists from all over the world to one meeting covering all disciplines of the Earth, planetary, and space sciences.


Long-term Archive Challenges: Enhancing Data Discovery via Multilevel Metadata Aggregations At Scale  
Graham Parton’s poster will be displayed on Tuesday 9th April between 08:00-19:30. However, Graham will be at his poster between 14:00-15:45 in Hall 1 location 55.


This work discussed the way CEDA pulls together metadata at various levels to give a comprehensive approach to its data cataloguing. At the finest grained level this involved harvesting metadata such as parameter information directly from 220 million files in the archive! However, that approach has to be augmented with a complementary Manual Metadata Store to cover our large number of datasets where this isn’t possible, those which are: offline, external, have been removed from the archive or simply can’t be scanned or yield incorrect file-level metadata.

Gathering impact stories from JASMIN users  
Poppy Townsend is giving a talk on Wednesday at 11.45 in Room L8.


This work summarises the work undertaken by Poppy’s MSc project and subsequent actions CEDA have implemented since its completion. CEDA are frequently required to provide impact evidence of our services in order to receive additional and/or continued funding. Key findings and recommendations will be discussed, alongside how we have begun to implement a regular collection process for evidencing impact information.

Delivering resilient access to global climate projections data for the Copernicus Climate Data Store using a distributed data infrastructure and hybrid cloud model  
Phil Kershaw delivering a talk on Thursday 15:15–15:30 in Room M1.


We describe the development of a resilient, distributed data infrastructure created to serve global climate projections data to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS). The CDS provides a single public point of access for freely available climate-related observations, re-analyses and model data. This is achieved using a distributed architecture, with individual participating data providers hosting and serving data through to the CDS via an agreed set of web service interfaces. The CP4CDS project was established to provide access to a quality controlled subset of CMIP5 model data and is led by CEDA working together with partners DKRZ and IPSL.
