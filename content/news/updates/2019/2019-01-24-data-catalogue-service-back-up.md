The CEDA Data Catalogue service is available once again following the completion of our move to using HTTPS for this service.


This switch is part of a wider move to HTTPS for CEDA services and part of a suite improvements rolled out for the data calalogue (more news about this to follow soon).


Apologies for any inconvenience caused.


CEDA Team
