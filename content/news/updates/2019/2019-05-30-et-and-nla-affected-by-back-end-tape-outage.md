There is a problem with the tape drives behind these systems which is being addressed urgently.


Until the problem is fixed, data can be registered for ingestion but will not be sent to tape until the problem is fixed. Likewise, any retrieval requests submitted are likely to stall.


Apologies for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
