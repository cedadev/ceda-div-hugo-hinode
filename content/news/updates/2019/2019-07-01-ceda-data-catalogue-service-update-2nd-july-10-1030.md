The CEDA data catalogue service will be temporarily offline between 10:00 - 10:30 tomorrow, 2nd July to allow for the roll out of an update.


The update will allow for non-geospatial data to be better handled within the catalogue with a minor adjustment to the user view of associated dataset and dataset collection records.


Apologies for the inconvenience that this may cause.


CEDA Team
