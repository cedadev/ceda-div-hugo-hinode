JANET and STFC networking have announced maintenance work on the RAL site primary network link on Saturday. This will likely affect the JASMIN private networks (OPNs) to MetOffice , Archer and Leeds. The disruption will involve breaks of up to an hour on Saturday morning.


In principal this should not affect normal connections to JASMIN via routes other than these links, as the primary RAL connection should fail over to a secondary while the work is undertaken. The OPN circuits do not have backup links however.


Please consider whether this maintenance work will affect your connection to JASMIN during this period.
