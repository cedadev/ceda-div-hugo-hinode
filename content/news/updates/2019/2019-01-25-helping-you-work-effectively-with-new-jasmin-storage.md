JASMIN continues to grow as a unique collaborative analysis environment for an expanding community of scientists. We have attempted to address some big challenges, such as the ever-growing demand for storage space and the increasing diversity of scientific workflows, with the Phase 4 upgrade. However, we’re aware that some aspects of the changes introduced in Phase 4 have presented some challenges in themselves. Therefore, we have put together some new documentation about the challenges and summarised what can be done to help deal with them.


Most of the solutions require help from you, our user community, to ensure best practice for the new storage is followed. There are now four different types of storage, each optimised for different scientific workflows.

If everyone can make the required changes to their personal workflows, then it will help improve JASMIN performance for all users. Please take some time to familiarise yourself with the documentation listed below, which explains the challenges/solutions in detail:


[Understanding new JASMIN storage](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4700-understanding-new-jasmin-storage) - this gives information about the new storage and what workflows work best for each technology.


[New storage FAQs and issues](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4702-faqs-storage) - this describes specific common known issues, with some suggested solutions.


[Access to storage](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/176-storage) - this is an older document, but it gives a good overview on how to use JASMIN storage.


We will continue to update these documents when new issues or solutions are found. If you are still experiencing difficulties or slow performance (after checking the documentation) and are unsure why, then contact our [helpdesk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk) being sure to include [this specific information](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4703-how-to-contact-us-about-jasmin-issues) (also listed below) which will help us answer your query more efficiently.
