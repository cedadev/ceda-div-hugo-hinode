At some time this morning Â (Weds 17th July) there may be a short interruption to connectivity of services within the JASMIN Data Transfer Zone (DTZ) to storage.


Data transfers may (including those via the CEDA FTP download service) may pause briefly but users with interactive sessions on servers jasmin-xfer[23] may experience some temporary freezing of terminal sessions.


This urgent work is part of a plan to upgrade network capacity from the JASMIN DTZ to the outside world, however further steps are needed before the full upgraded capacity is implemented: watch this space!


Apologies for the short notice and any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
