We are aware of issues for users accessing JASMIN. We are currently investigating the cause and will update with more details viaÂ the JASMIN mailing list, [news channel](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cedanews) when we know more details.


Please check these channels for updates rather than emailing the helpdesk, as we will be focussing on fixing the issues before we address any outstanding helpdesk queries.


Apologies for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN team
