Earlier this month, CEDA provided a two day Researchers Forum on behalf of the National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO). 26 delegates attended the event which covered the theme of preparing data for the CEDA Archive and using JASMIN to process data. The training was provided by CEDA staff and included presentations, a practical workshop and tours of JASMIN and RAL Space facilities.
