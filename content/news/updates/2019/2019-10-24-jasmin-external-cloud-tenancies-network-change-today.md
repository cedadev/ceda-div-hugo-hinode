A network change that will affect a number of virtual machines in External Cloud tenancies is scheduled for today, October 24. If your VMs are going to be affected, you have been already notified about the potential disruption, and you need to take no further action. The disruption will happen in an ad-hoc manner during the day and it will last an expected maximum of 5 minutes per case.


Apologies for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN team
