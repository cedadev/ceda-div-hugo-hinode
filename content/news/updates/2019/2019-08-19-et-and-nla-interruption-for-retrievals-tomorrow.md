Retrievals from the ET and NLA services will not be possible from 0700 tomorrow, Tuesday 20th August, until 1300. This is to allow the replacement of hardware within the tape system.


Data can be registered for sending to tape, but will be paused until the end of the intervention.


Apologies for the inevitable inconvenience.
