The databases of the tape back-end to these systems are having security patches from 09:00 on Wednesday 6th November.


The process could take up to 4 hours.  
While the process should be transparent, there is a small risk of individual retrievals being disrupted or delayed, so users are advised to check that any retrievals have completed properly during this period.
