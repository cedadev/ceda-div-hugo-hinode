The hardware problems that are affecting the tape system are more severe than previously thought. This means that the hardware is being replaced and so the outage must be extended.


It is now expected that the service will be available from 16:00 tomorrow, Tuesday the 6th.


Apologies for the short notice and thank you for your continued patience.
