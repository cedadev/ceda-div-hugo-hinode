Yesterday’s scheduled maintenance went well and we anticipate services to be back to normal. However, we are aware of a few outstanding issues - we are working on these and will update on progress here.


The most common issue, which was a 404 error on data.ceda.ac.uk, should now be resolved, please let us know if you see further errors.


Thank you for bearing with us during the maintenance.


Best wishes,   
CEDA team
