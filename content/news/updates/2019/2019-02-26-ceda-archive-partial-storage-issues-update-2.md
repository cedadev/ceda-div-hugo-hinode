CEDA are still in the process of restoring the affected parts of the archive. Some priority datasets have already been restored from backups and are now visible. We are anticipating some problems with access from JASMIN due to the permissions being incorrectly set, we will endeavour to correct these as soon as possible.


Approximately 15% of the missing data has now been recovered from the tape back ups to our processing area. These data then need to be moved back onto the CEDA Archive, currently 7% has been copied back onto the archive.


Full recovery of the missing data is still estimated to take about a month for completion. We will continue to post regular updates on progress.


Large parts of the CEDA Archive do still remain intact and fully accessible.


We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused in the meanwhile.


CEDA team
