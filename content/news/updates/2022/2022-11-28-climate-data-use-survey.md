CEDA would like to learn how climate data is being used outside the academic research community (for example, industry partners, risk management companies, teachers and educators, local authorities, members of the public, policy makers and advisers, planners). This is to provide feedback to our funders and help us to design future services - without continued funding CEDA services would cease to exist.


We are particularly interested in hearing from users of CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX climate data and we invite you to complete this short survey: <https://forms.gle/n1gZreY9UBigQ2x59>.


Deadline for completing the survey: 20th December 2022



Thank you for your help!
