If you are part of a community that makes use of data from the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip), please consider completing the survey. Details from the project team below. 


  
They are particularly interested in hearing from users of the data, from the academic and policy-making world - please share widely!

The [WCRP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/) Working Group on Coupled Modelling ([WGCM](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/ipo-esmo-groups/modelling-wgcm)) and the CMIP Panel are already working hard in preparation for the next phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Specifically, we need to hear from everyone their views on the positive aspects and challenges they faced in CMIP6, and how they would like to see future phases of CMIP structured and delivered. 


 


For that, we are inviting the community to take part in the “**CMIP Community next steps survey**”. It is your chance to help us shape the future of CMIP! 


 


Complete the survey here: [https://www.wcrp-climate.org/cmip-survey](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/cmip-survey "https://www.wcrp-climate.org/cmip-survey")


We strongly encourage you to share this survey as broadly as you can. We are in particular very keen to have responses from users of the data, from the academic and policy-making world. 


 


Deadline for completing the survey: **28****February 2022**   
  
Thanks for helping us in making CMIP better!
