Dear users,  
  



Please note upcoming maintenance work with “possible” service interruption affecting JASMIN from 9:30am until 2pm on Monday 1st August. The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 06:00 am on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished. We will release the reservation early if the work is completed early.  
  



Thank you in advance for your cooperation and apologies for the inconvenience.  
  



JASMIN Team
