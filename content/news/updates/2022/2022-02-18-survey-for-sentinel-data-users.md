Do you use Sentinel satellite data for your work? Our colleagues at [JNCC](https://jncc.gov.uk) are asking users of Sentinel (1&2) data how they are using it and to inform future plans for analysis-ready data. 


You can find the survey here: [**https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/S1\_S2\_ARD\_user\_survey/**](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartsurvey.co.uk%2Fs%2FS1_S2_ARD_user_survey%2F&data=04%7C01%7CPaula.Lightfoot%40jncc.gov.uk%7C744c591ea50940e7776f08d9f228432a%7C444ee4e8b2fd491d8c318b0508370a6b%7C0%7C0%7C637807077028300200%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=4u08cCWXUx3jiGnW1FC8bHt%2FlvgjFIBz%2BzK5PB8%2FGfE%3D&reserved=0)



The survey should take no more than 10 minutes to complete and can be filled in anonymously if people prefer.




We would be very grateful if people could fill it in by **Friday 4th March** and also circulate it to others in their network.
