Dear users,   
  
A major component of the recent work scheduled for 1st March was not able to take place, so an alternative date has now been set for this part of the work.   
  
On Tuesday 29th March, work will be undertaken which affects JASMINâ€™s SOF (scale-out filesystem) storage. This affects:  
   
\*All storage volumes in the CEDA Archive   
\*Most group workspaces (those with paths starting /gws/nopw/j04/)   
\*XFC areas with paths starting /work/xfc/vol4/   
  
Storage servers will be upgraded to a new software version, and new versions of the client software rolled out to machines which access it.   
  
This is a relatively major intervention which will inevitably cause some disruption. CEDA and JASMIN services will be affected, with many services unavailable for at least the first part of the day.


The LOTUS batch processing cluster will also be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day 29th March, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 06:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.  
  
We advise you to plan your work accordingly to minimise the impact, but please accept our apologies in advance for any inconvenience.   
  
JASMIN Team
