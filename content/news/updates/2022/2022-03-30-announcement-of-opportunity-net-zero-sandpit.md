As part of the [Net Zero Digital Research Infrastructure Scoping project](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/), we invite researchers and practitioners to come together in two [‘sandpit’](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/sandpit/) style events.  


  
These sandpit events will be used to allocate the funding for involvement of the community in [proof-of-concept studies](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/proof-of-concept/) and [workshops](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/workshops/). Evidence gathered from these activities will be used to inform recommendations and map a pathway for the implementation of the UKRI Net Zero strategic ambitions within the Digital Research Infrastructure.   
  
Sandpit A will focus on *community and organisational challenges* such as: user facing services, data management, behaviour change, training, proportionality of energy use, who are the winners/losers, and monitoring and driving change.  
  
Sandpit B will focus on *technical and operational challenges*such as: hardware procurement, design and architecture of infrastructure, cloud platforms, consolidation, power management and efficiency, end-of-life, and carbon capture and offsetting.   
  
Further details and how to apply can be found [on the project website](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/sandpit/). 


Please note that the deadline for funding to help @UKRI\_News digital research infrastructure reach net zero has been extended to Thursday 28th 1pm
