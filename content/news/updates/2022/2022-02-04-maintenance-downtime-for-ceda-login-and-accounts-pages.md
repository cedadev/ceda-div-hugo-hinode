Dear CEDA users,   
  
We are planning an update to the CEDA login and account management servers between 10:00 am and 11:00 am on Tuesday, the 8th of February. During this time you may be unable to login to CEDA websites or check your account details.   
  
The update is part of a series of changes we are implementing to expand upon the CEDA accounts system and make it more user friendly.   
  
Apart from possible disruption to user login, other CEDA services should continue to operate as normal. Existing login sessions will not be affected.


Sorry for any inconveniences caused and thank you for your patience at this time


CEDA Team
