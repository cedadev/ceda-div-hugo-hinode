Dear users,



Please note that there is potential for disruption to JASMIN services from **Monday 18th July at 10am till Tuesday 19th July evening** as a result of extreme heat forecast for RAL, where JASMIN is hosted. It may become necessary to take action to reduce load on JASMIN if cooling equipment is unable to keep up with demand



Many thanks for your cooperation



JASMIN team
