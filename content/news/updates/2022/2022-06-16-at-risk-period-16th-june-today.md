Dear users,  
  



Please note upcoming "at risk" period and maintenance work affecting JASMIN & CEDA this week and next week:  
  



1. **Thursday 16th June "at risk" period between 7:30 am and 9:30 am:**


As part of the ongoing preparatory work for the network change on the weekend of 18/19th June, there will be a further at-risk period between 7:30 am and 9:30 am on Thursday 16th June i.e. tomorrow. It should either be transparent to the users, or cause a few minutes outage while issues are resolved. 



2. **Advance notice of STFC network intervention, 18-22 June 2022**



Over the weekend of 18/19 June, there will be NO ACCESS to the RAL network, in which JASMIN is hosted, so there will be no access to JASMIN and CEDA services. Work is expected to continue on Monday 20th & Tuesday 21st June affecting some or all parts of the network. This work is being carried out by STFC’s network team. We will provide further details as these become available.


We advise you to plan your work accordingly to minimise the impact, but please accept our apologies in advance for any inconvenience.



JASMIN Team
