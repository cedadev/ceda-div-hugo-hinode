Dear CEDA users,   
  
We are currently in the process of rolling out a number of improvements to our accounts and login systems. As part of this process, we are asking users to log in to their CEDA accounts and reset or change their password if they havenâ€™t already done so in the last month.   
  
The reason for this is that we will soon be making it mandatory for older users to set a new password on their account to improve security across CEDA services. Setting a new password now will future-proof your login and you should not experience any disruption.   
  
If you no longer require access to your CEDA account, you can ignore this message.   
  
CEDA Team
