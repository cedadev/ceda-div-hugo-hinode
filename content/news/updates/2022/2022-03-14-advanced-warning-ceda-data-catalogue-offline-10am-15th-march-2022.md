The CEDA data catalogue service ([https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/)) will be temporarily affected tomorrow at 10 am whilst the catalogue service is provisioned with additional resources.


The interruption to the service is expected to only be temporary and normal service should resume shortly after.


Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
