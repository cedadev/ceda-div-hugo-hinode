We are currently experiences some disruption to CEDA archive services while we upgrade our storage systems. 


We anticipated some short outages of our data ingestion services, but it looks likely that these may run over until tomorrow. 


We are aware that the data distribution service are currently affected too, but these are likely to be back in the next hour.


 Apologies for any inconvenience.
