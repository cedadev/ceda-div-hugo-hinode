There is currently a problem with the host which serves application software in JASMIN/LOTUS. It is currently not accessible, which means that it is not possible to load any modules under /apps/modulefiles or /apps/contrib. The issue is currently being investigated. 


Apologies for any inconvenience meanwhile. 


JASMIN Team.
