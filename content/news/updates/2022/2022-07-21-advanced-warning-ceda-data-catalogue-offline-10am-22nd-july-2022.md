The CEDA data catalogue service ([https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk)) will be temporarily affected tomorrow at 10am for a planned roll-out of new features and bug fixes. The roll-out should only last a few minutes after which normal service will resume.  
  



Apologies for any inconvenience caused.  
  



CEDA Team
