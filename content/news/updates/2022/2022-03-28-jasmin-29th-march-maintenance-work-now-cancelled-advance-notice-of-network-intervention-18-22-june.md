Dear users,


**1. CANCELLED: Further storage maintenance 29th March 2022**


Maintenance work on storage scheduled for tomorrow 29th March has now been cancelled by the vendor. A new date will be arranged in due course so please look out for further announcements.


The reservation which was in place on the LOTUS batch processing cluster has now been removed.


**2. Advance notice of STFC network intervention, 18-22 June 2022**


Over the weekend of 18/19 June, there will be NO ACCESS to the RAL network, in which JASMIN is hosted, so there will be no access to JASMIN and CEDA services. Work is expected to continue on Monday 20th & Tuesday 21st June affecting some or all parts of the network. This work is being carried out by STFCâ€™s network team. We will provide further details as these become available.


We advise you to plan your work accordingly to minimise the impact, but please accept our apologies in advance for any inconvenience.


JASMIN Team
