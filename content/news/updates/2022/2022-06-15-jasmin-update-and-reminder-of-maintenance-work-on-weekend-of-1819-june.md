Dear users,  
  



Please note upcoming maintenance work affecting JASMIN & CEDA during next week:  
  



1. Quarterly maintenance day & storage update: 14th June completed!


Work to update storage systems is now completed. Important updates were applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure in order to keep them up to date and secure. Users are now able to access JASMIN.   
  



2. Advance notice of STFC network intervention, 18-22 June 2022


Over the weekend of 18/19 June, there will be NO ACCESS to the RAL network, in which JASMIN is hosted, so there will be no access to JASMIN and CEDA services. Work is expected to continue on Monday 20th & Tuesday 21st June affecting some or all parts of the network. This work is being carried out by STFC’s network team. We will provide further details as these become available.


We advise you to plan your work accordingly to minimise the impact, but please accept our apologies in advance for any inconvenience.  
  



JASMIN Team
