Dear users,   
  
This is the final reminder to please be aware of the following maintenance periods scheduled over coming weeks which may affect you:  
  
**1. JASMIN Quarterly maintenance day:** Tuesday 1st March Scheduled maintenance is planned for this date and will, unfortunately, cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services.


**2. Border router firmware upgrade:** Wednesday 2nd March between 7-8am. This has been done many times before and theres a short few seconds network interuption when the network switches to backup router and backup janet connection.Â   
  
**On this occasion, due to the nature and extent of the work being carried out, users will not able to access JASMIN for large parts of the day. This affects the LOTUS batch processing cluster, significant parts of JASMIN storage, and many virtual machines on which services may be running.**   
  
**You are advised to plan your work accordingly to avoid this date.**   
  
On a regular (roughly quarterly) basis, important updates are applied to systems within the JASMIN infrastructure (which also hosts the CEDA Archive and associated services) in order to keep them up to date and secure. Servers may need to be rebooted in order for these changes to take effect, so there may be an interruption to JASMIN and CEDA services on this date.   
Other system work is also scheduled for these dates in order to minimise disruption.   
  
The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 06:00 on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.   
  
Please look out for further announcements as these dates approach, and apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused.  
  
 JASMIN Team
