CEDA users can now find out more about some of the data we hold with the recent publication of our 1st data paper in the [Geoscience Data Journal](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-GDJ3.html). Papers in data journals are fully citable articles detailing the data as a valuable scientific resource in its own right – giving due academic credit to the data producers through a fully peer reviewed process. These papers include details about the dataset itself, how and why it was created and suggests further uses for the data.


 


In addition to the easily referenced and discoverable dataset details, data papers also provide links to their related data in a dedicated repository, such as CEDA’s British Atmospheric Data Centre, through the use of persistent Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).


 


CEDA’s first paper, entitled “The GBS dataset: measurements of satellite site diversity at 20.7 GHz in the UK” was authored by S. A. Callaghan, J. Waight, J. L. Agnew, C. J. Walden, C. L. Wrench and S. Ventouras, can be found at <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gdj3.2/full> describing these three datasets held at CEDA:


 


[GBS 20.7 GHz slant path radio propagation measurements, Chilbolton site](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/639A3714-BC74-46A6-9026-64931F355E07 "Link to Chilbolton GBS 20.7 Ghz measurements metadata page")


[GBS 20.7 GHz slant path radio propagation measurements, Dundee site](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/db8d8981-1a51-4d6e-81c0-cced9b921390 "Link to Dundee GBS 20.7 Ghz measurements metadata page")


[GBS 20.7 GHz slant path radio propagation measurements, Sparsholt site](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/E8F43A51-0198-4323-A926-FE69225D57DD "Link to Sparsholt 20.7 Ghz measurements metadata page")


 


For more information about obtaining DOIs for your own data, and so gain due academic credit for the important work that underpins your published datasets, please feel free to contact us and we’ll be happy to advise on the process.
