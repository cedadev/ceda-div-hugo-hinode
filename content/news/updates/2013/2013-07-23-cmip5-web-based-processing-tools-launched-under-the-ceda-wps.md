CEDA is pleased to announce the release of two new web-based processing tools under the [CEDA Web Processing Service (WPS)](http://ceda-wps.badc.rl.ac.uk "Link to CEDA WPS").


These processes, known as the "CMIP5 Global Averager" and "CMIP5 Regridder", allow the user to select a set of CMIP5 file paths before running the selected process.


The "CMIP5 Global Averager" calculates global means for every field whilst the "CMIP5 Regridder" interpolates the input fields on to a regular 1 or 2 degree lat/lon grid.


Both tools use the [Climate Data Operators (CDO)](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo "Link to CDO site") to perform the selected process.


 


For more information on how to use these new WPS processes please see the user guide at:

We invite feedback on these processes so that we can continue to improve them.
