The British Atmospheric Data Centre are interested in how the amateur meteorology community collects and archives its weather data. To help us gain a better understanding of the amateur meteorological community and how it deals with the data it collects we would like to invite all amateur meteorologists to complete a short survey:

We hope to use the results from this short survey to help us identify how we can improve our support for the amateur meteorologist community.


 


The Survey will close at the end of the year in order to give ample opportunity for the amateur community to complete it.
