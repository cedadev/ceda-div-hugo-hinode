Dear JASMIN users,  
  
This message includes information about the following:  
  
1. Update on SLURM and the CentOS7 LOTUS cluster  
2. Timeline to retire old RHEL6 login, sci and data transfer servers  
3. New high-memory CentOS7 sci machines  
  
Details of the update  
  
1. LOTUS resources under LSF have been converted over to SLURM. All LOTUS users are expected to use SLURM. For details, please see our webinar and presentation on transitioning from LSF to SLURM: [webinar](/events/past/slurm-webinar/)   
  
More information about SLURM is available on our help pages:<https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/category/4889-slurm>

*jasmin-login2.ceda.ac.uk*  
*jasmin-login3.ceda.ac.uk*  
*jasmin-login4.ceda.ac.uk*  
*cems-login1.cems.rl.ac.uk*
