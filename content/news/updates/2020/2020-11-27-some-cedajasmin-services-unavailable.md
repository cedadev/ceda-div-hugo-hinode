Over the last year, the team has worked hard to migrate all of our services to a new operating system (CentOS7). The deadline for this work to be achieved is Monday 30th November. The majority of user-facing services have now been migrated successfully with minimal disruption to users. However, a small number of services still need to be migrated.


Unfortunately, some updates are running behind schedule and some services will be unavailable from Monday. You can see a list of the affected services in the spreadsheet here.


The most popular service that will be affected is the CEDA Web Processing Service - details about the planned work schedule for this service can be found in the second tab of [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FNF3F4GuC8vXVD0mVU7nnswIziM97PMMzHbGWHi4W6k/edit#gid=0).


We will complete the final migration work as soon as possible - thank you for bearing with us.


Apologies for the inconvenience caused.   
CEDA team
