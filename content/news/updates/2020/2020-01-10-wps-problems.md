The below issue with the CEDA Web Processing Service (WPS) has now been resolved. If you are still experiencing issues, please let us know. 


CEDA team


-----------------------------



The [CEDA Web Processing Service (WPS)](http://wps-web1.ceda.ac.uk/) is currently unavailable due to a problem with it's storage that is not allowing outputs to be written. The systems admin team are presently investigating this issue and we hope that normal service will resume soon. 


  
A further news item will be posted when the service is once again operational.   
  
We apologise for the intertuption of this service.
