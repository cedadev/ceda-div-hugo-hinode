To allow security patching and upgrades in the tape back-end, these services will be unavailable from 08:00 until 15:00.


While any data ingestions in progress will be paused during this period, users are requested to have completed any retrievals by 17:00 on the evening of the 10th, as any which may still be in progress the next morning will risk being cancelled to allow work to progress.
