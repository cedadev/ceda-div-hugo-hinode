Dear users,


Maintenance work to the tape library has now been completed including tests to check that all is operating as expected. The tape library, and hence all tape services: Elastic Tape (ET), Joint Data Migration App (JDMA), StorageD (SD) and Near Line Archive (NLA) are therefore ready for use again.


Thank you for your cooperation, and apologies for any inconvenience caused.
