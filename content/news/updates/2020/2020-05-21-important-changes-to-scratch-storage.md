Dear JASMIN users,  
  
**Please note the following changes which affect both** */work/scratch* **and** */work/scratch-nompiio*  
We are pleased to announce that a new scratch volume */work/scratch-pw* will be available from **Wednesday 27th May**. This volume will be on PFS (parallel file system) storage with a total capacity of 1 Petabyte, but will have automated processes in place to “police” usage. This new volume, */work/scratch-pw* will be a replacement for the current */work/scratch* volume.


Important dates:  
*/work/scratch* is available for READ and WRITE access until **26th June**  
*/work/scratch* will be available for READ access only from **26th June until 31st July**  
*/work/scratch-nompiio* will be emptied before being decreased in size and renamed to */work/scratch-nopw* on **27th May.**


As always with scratch storage, any important data should be moved away to other storage if it is to be kept for any length of time. The primary purpose of scratch storage is for intermediate storage for batch processing jobs on LOTUS. To “police” this, and to preserve the availability of scratch space for all LOTUS users, automated processes will be run at weekly intervals to purge all data older than 28 days.  
   
We are also taking this opportunity to adopt the naming convention ‘pw’ and ‘nopw’ to help users distinguish between “parallel write” (pw) and “no parallel write” (nopw) capabilities of these volumes. See also

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
