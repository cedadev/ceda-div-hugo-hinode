Dear users,


This is a reminder to please be aware that further maintenance work on the tape library system used is now scheduled for Tuesday 18th August 2020 for one day, however it will be taken out of service from 17:00 today to clear any queued tasks first.  
This will mean that the Elastic Tape (ET, whether accessed directly or via the JDMA interface) and Near-Line Archive services will be unavailable for this period.


We apologize for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
