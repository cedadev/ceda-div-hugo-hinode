There will be a freeze on any changes requested to JASMIN between Friday 24th January and Monday 3rd February. This is due to limited staff availability during this time.


This change freeze means:   
There may be slower response times to helpdesk queries   
A delay in fixing problems related to system issues  
Slower response to queries requesting changes (such as new volumes or tenancies, changes to quotaâ€™s etc.)


We apologise for the inevitable disruption this will cause. Normal service will resume from Tuesday 4th February when all requests will be dealt with as soon as possible.
