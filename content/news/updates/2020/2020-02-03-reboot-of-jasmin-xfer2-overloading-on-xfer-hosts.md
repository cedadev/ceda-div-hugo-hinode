We will shortly be rebooting transfer host jasmin-xfer2.ceda.ac.uk to clear problems mainly due to overloading.


We are aware that the current period is proving very busy for the transfer servers, with many users moving data from the RDF to JASMIN. Please bear in mind that these servers are for shared use and that overloading by running multiple transfers at once will have an impact on the usability of the servers and possibly cause disruption for other users. Please be considerate in your use of these machines during this busy period.


Thanks in advance for your cooperation.  
JASMIN Team
