We are pleased to announce that the two new scientific analysis servers, “[sci1.jasmin.ac.uk](http://sci1.jasmin.ac.uk/)” and “[sci2.jasmin.ac.uk](http://sci2.jasmin.ac.uk/)” are now available with the CentOS7 systems and the new software environments1. These two VMs are available for testing and they are listed in the table of available “sci” servers shown when you log in to any of the login servers. [Please note that the domain name of the new “sci” servers has changed from “[.ceda.ac.uk](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/)” to “[.jasmin.ac.uk](http://jasmin.ac.uk/)”].


Further information about the “sci” servers can be found at: <https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/121-sci-servers>


We encourage users to start testing their workflows using the new “sci” servers, “[sci[1,2].jasmin.ac.uk](http://jasmin.ac.uk/)” and report their feedback to the CEDA helpdesk.


Note 1: The documentation about the new software environments on JASMINis currently provided as a single web-based document (PDF). Please review the documentation here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gD9C0TZyNITibgDhlv3pRzgd4JjzVfBW/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gD9C0TZyNITibgDhlv3pRzgd4JjzVfBW/view)  
The CentOS7 login (bastion or gateway) servers "login1.jasmin.ac.uk" and "login4.jsmin.ac.uk" are available to access resources within JASMIN.

Thank you for your attention and please look out for further updates as this work progresses.
