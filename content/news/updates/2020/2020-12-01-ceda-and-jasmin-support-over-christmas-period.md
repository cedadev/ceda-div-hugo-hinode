As we approach the Christmas period, please be aware of the limited support arrangements in place which will result in CEDA and JASMIN services running “at-risk”.




While the shutdown of CEDA’s host organisation, STFC, runs from 15:00 on Thursday 24th December 2020 to 09:00 on Monday 4th January 2021, only very few staff remain at work from Friday 18th December, so we are unable to offer a normal helpdesk service from that date onwards.



**CEDA and JASMIN services should therefore be considered to be running “at-risk” from 17:00 on Thursday 17th December to Monday 4th January 2021, with little or no helpdesk service available during this period.**



**A “change freeze” is also in place as of 17:00 on Friday 11th December, so requests for new or changes to existing services will not be dealt with until the New Year.**  




CEDA websites, archives and services, including access to JASMIN, should be available during this period but will operate unsupported. Therefore should any problems occur to our services, it is unlikely that these would be fixed until staff return in the New Year.



Only emergency cover for site services (for issues such as fire or power outage) remains in place during the site shutdown period, and although we anticipate that the JASMIN infrastructure will remain operational throughout, it is possible that some issues may not receive attention until staff return in the New Year.  



All user queries received during this period will be answered as soon as possible from Monday 4th January 2021. 



The CEDA and JASMIN teams would like to take this opportunity to wish all our users a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
