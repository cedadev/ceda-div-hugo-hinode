In line with the bank holiday shutdown of CEDA's host institute, the CEDA and JASMIN teams will be unavailable from 16:00 today (Friday 28th August) until 09:00 on Wednesday 2nd September.  
  
CEDA websites, archives and services, including access to JASMIN, should be available during this period but will operate unsupported. Therefore should any problems occur to our services, it is unlikely that these would be fixed until staff return on Wednesday 2nd September.   
  
Many staff members are taking advantage of the bank holiday for a longer break and will not be working again until 7th September. Therefore, there will be minimal helpdesk support during the week of the bank holiday due to limited staff availability. All user queries received during this period will be answered as soon as possible.  
  
Thank you for your understanding,   
CEDA/JASMIN team
