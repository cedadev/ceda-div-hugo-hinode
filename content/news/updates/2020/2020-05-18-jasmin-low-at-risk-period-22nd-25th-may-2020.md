Electrical work planned on the RAL site has a small risk of loss of power to the JASMIN data centre around the Bank Holiday weekend (**22nd-25th May**). The risk of disruption is small but would result in all JASMIN and CEDA services being offline for several days if power was lost.  
   
During this period, work is being undertaken on the STFC RAL site (JASMINâ€™s host institution) as part of the construction of the new [Rosalind Franklin Institute](https://www.rfi.ac.uk/). Electrical work aims to connect this new facility to the site high-voltage supply which also supplies JASMIN. There is a small risk of loss of power to the JASMIN data centre while this work is undertaken. Loss of power would disrupt all CEDA and JASMIN services, and other STFC network services, which support remote working for STFC and JASMIN support staff, for many days if it happened.


To mitigate this impact STFC Estates, in association with the electrical contractor, SSE, will provide suitable generator capacity to cover the period of 5-7 days for which the main feed will be down.


In addition, a power off restart procedure would take several days, especially because of the implications of social distancing protocols, it has been agreed that JASMIN/CEDA services would take priority during such an operation.


With apologies for any inconvenience caused,


JASMIN Team
