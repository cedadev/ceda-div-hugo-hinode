We believe the below issues are now resolved. Please contact us if you are still experiencing issues downloading data via dap.ceda.ac.uk



Thank you for your patience during the disruption.

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
  
We are aware of an intermittent issue with some of the archive storage. It is mainly affecting our key download service (dap.ceda.ac.uk). This means that it is frequently going offline (AKA conking out) and users are therefore unable to access data via this download route. We are investigating the cause but at present are unable to resolve the issue.   
  
If you are experiencing difficulties downloading data you may want to try our alternative download routes. The options (with caveats) are listed below:   
  
**DAP** - this is our usual download route but this is what we are currently having problems with. When it is broken you will see a timeout error message. This service is pointed to from our main data browser (data.ceda.ac.uk).   
  
**FTP** - this route will request you to log in with your CEDA account details. You can access it here: ftp://ftp.ceda.ac.uk/  
  
**FTP Anon** - this route doesn’t require a log in. However it currently holds very limited datasets. So you may not be able to see the data you are after - we are working on increasing the range of datasets. You can access it here: ftp://anon-ftp.ceda.ac.uk/  
  
**Via JASMIN** - for users with JASMIN accounts, you can access the data as normal from the jasmin-sci machines.   
  
We have created a status page where you can see if we are having problems with our key data services. You can find it here: <https://stats.uptimerobot.com/vZPgQt7YnO>   
  
We are working on a solution for this issue and hope to resolve it soon. Sorry for the inevitable inconvenience and frustration.
