Dear JASMIN users,


As previously announced:


* The old scratch volume */work/scratch* remains available READ ONLY until Friday 31st July but will then be retired.
* A new volume */work/scratch-pw* is now in place on PFS (parallel file system) storage with a total capacity of 1 Petabyte.
* Both */work/scratch-pw* and */work/scratch-nopw* have automated processes to “police” usage by deleting files that have not been accessed for the past 28 days.


Please be aware that this automated clearout process will now start running on a weekly basis **from this Friday 17th July.**


As always with scratch storage, any important data should be moved away to other storage if it is to be kept for any length of time. The primary purpose of scratch storage is for intermediate storage for batch processing jobs on LOTUS and is shared by all users.


The naming convention ‘pw’ and ‘nopw’ is to help users distinguish between “parallel write” (pw) and “no parallel write” (nopw) capabilities of these volumes. See also

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  
JASMIN Team
