The planned 2020 upgrade for JASMIN will include a substantial upgrade to JASMIN GPU capacity. While we have a panel of experts helping us develop requirements, it will be useful for us to get direct feedback about actual and potential GPU usage within the community of existing and potential JASMIN users. To that end we have a short survey. It should only take 5-10 minutes to complete, and we would value you doing that before the end of June.
