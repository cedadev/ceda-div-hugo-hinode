Dear users,


As previously announced, maintenance work is currently underway to add additional capacity to the tape library shared by CEDA and JASMIN tape services. The tape library, and hence all tape services: Elastic Tape (ET) and StorageD (SD) and Near Line Archive (NLA) are currently unavailable.


Once the work has been completed, some testing will be performed to check that services are operating as expected. Please refrain from accessing these services until a further announcement is made that the services are ready for use again.


Thanks in advance for your cooperation, and apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
