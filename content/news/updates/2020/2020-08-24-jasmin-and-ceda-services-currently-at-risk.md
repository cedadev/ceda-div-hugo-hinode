We are currently experiencing issues affecting our entire virtualisation platform. This is likely to include login and sci-analysis machines, VMs in the JASMIN Cloud and many JASMIN/CEDA services. Please consider all services at-risk/unavailable until further notice.


We are investigating and will update you with more information ASAP. 


Apologies for the inevitable inconvenience caused, 


JASMIN team
