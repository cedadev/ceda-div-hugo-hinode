The below work has now been completed and all services are back to normal.Â 


------------------------------------------------


An issue has been identified with one of the hypervisors (virtualisation servers) which hosts a number of CEDA and JASMIN virtual machines.


A reboot of the hypervisor is needed to clear the issue but this will mean that some or all of the following virtual machines are not available for some time (hopefully a few seconds, but could be a few minutes) tomorrow morning Friday 7th Feb 2020 around 09:00.


This would result in interruptions to service(s) running on these machines.


The VMs affected are:  
slcs2.ceda.ac.uk  
securitydb1.ceda.ac.uk  
rsg-nrt1.cems.rl.ac.uk  
rbq1.ceda.ac.uk  
rancher2.jc.rl.ac.uk  
nrt-atmos-prod.cems.rl.ac.uk  
k8s-node03.ceda.ac.uk  
jasmin-es3.ceda.ac.uk  
esgf-index6.ceda.ac.uk  
es10.ceda.ac.uk  
deposit2.ceda.ac.uk  
csw1.ceda.ac.uk  
cci-odp-data-staging.ceda.ac.uk  
backup8.ceda.ac.uk  
backup3.ceda.ac.uk  
arrivals2.ceda.ac.uk  
archdash1.ceda.ac.uk


Many of these are not outward-facing machines but are used for components of the CEDA and JASMIN service infrastructure, so there could be some knock-on effects on services.


We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, and thank you in advance for your cooperation.  
JASMIN Team
