We are delighted to announce the launch of our brand new JASMIN website - <https://www.jasmin.ac.uk/> . Take a look to see the difference!   
  
The new website has been drastically redesigned to provide more up to date information about JASMIN and give it a fresh new look. We hope it will give you a more coherent navigation experience between our different web services - including the help documentation, news and events. Some parts of the website are still in development (status and insights) but we wanted to include these new sections to show you what we’ve got planned.   
  
If you’ve got any comments on the new website, we’d love to [hear your thoughts](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BX3LRP6). We’ve attempted to transfer all content and links over efficiently - but if you notice any mistakes, broken links, or other issues please email the helpdesk.   
  
We hope that you enjoy using the new website!   
JASMIN team
