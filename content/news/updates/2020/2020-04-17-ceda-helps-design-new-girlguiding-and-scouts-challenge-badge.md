A group of [RAL Space](https://www.ralspace.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Scouts-and-Girl-Guides-reach-for-the-stars-with-a-new-Science-and-Engineering-Careers-Challenge-Badge-.aspx) graduates, including a member of the CEDA team, have created a new, free challenge for Girlguiding and Scout groups that is designed to introduce different science and engineering careers to young people, through hands-on activities.  
  
Team leader Kate Winfield, a CEDA data scientist, said their aim was “to create a [challenge](https://www.ralspace.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Science-and-Engineering-Careers-Challenge.aspx) that is fun and engaging and at the same time explores the diverse range of science and engineering careers found at STFC\*. All too often students are told to go into these fields not knowing how big these areas are. There are so many different types of science and engineering jobs out there!"   
  
In order to complete the challenge, Girlguiding and Scout groups must complete a range of activities based on the careers listed below:


* Electronic Engineer
* Mechanical Engineer
* Data Scientist
* Software Engineer
* Physicist
* Science Communication


There are 20 activities to choose from ranging from games to craft, exploring different science and engineering careers. Kate was keen to include activities focussed around the role of a Data Scientist in CEDA, these include; 


* Making a rain gauge and recording the data in a way that it can be preserved for long term reuse
* A satellite jigsaw game looking at earth observation
* Designing binary bracelets whilst exploring how data is stored


The [challenge pack](https://www.ralspace.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Science-and-Engineering-Careers-Challenge.aspx) ​contains activity instructions as well as background information about real careers and opportunities that young people, careers advisors, teachers and parents might otherwise not know exist.    
  
The challenge has already proven to be popular - there are currently 4750 badges on order with more on the way!   
  
The challenge was funded by the STFC graduate scheme and from the STFC Public Engagement Spark Award to produce the badges, which can be ordered upon completion of the challenge.
