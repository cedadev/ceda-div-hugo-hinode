We will soon be introducing two-step verification for JASMIN accounts in the next few months, take a look below to see how this will affect you. 


#### What is ‘two-step verification’ and why is it needed?


Two-step verification is commonly used for internet services to provide an extra layer of security for users. For JASMIN accounts, a verification code will be needed alongside a username and password when signing in to the [JASMIN Accounts Portal](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk). This helps prevent your account from being compromised even if an attacker steals your password. These verification codes are short-lived, single-use, 6-digit numbers that are sent to your registered email address when requested during the sign-in process.


#### When will this be rolled out?


Two-step verification will be introduced using a phased approach. Initially, it will be required only for users with access to particular sensitive JASMIN services before being rolled out to all users by the end of spring 2020.


#### What do I need to do?


This will require no action on your part other than using a verification code to log in to the JASMIN Accounts portal.   
  
This small, intuitive change to the signing in process will allow us to greatly improve security for JASMIN services. Note that SSH access to JASMIN will not be affected by this change. 


Thanks for your cooperation,
