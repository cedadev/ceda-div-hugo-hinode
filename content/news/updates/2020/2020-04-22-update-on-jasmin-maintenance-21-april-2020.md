Following scheduled maintenance on parts of the JASMIN system yesterday, please note the following:


- Servers were patched and rebooted where necessary to apply important updates. There were nearly double the number of hosts to update this time, as we transition from RHEL6 to CentOS7 operating systems, so this took longer than usual.


- Following the patching, GWS volumes under /group\_workspaces/jasmin4 are currently AT RISK due to problems with the metadata servers in this part of the storage system. Remote access to these servers is currently proving difficult and a physical intervention is likely to need arranging.


- Due to a separate hardware problem, the team was unable to undertake the network change also planned for yesterday. A new date for this work will be announced in due course.


With apologies for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
