The [CEDA Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/) service will be offline between 1700 and 1715 to allow the roll-out of a number of minor updates. These are primarily to aid internal CEDA work towards greater service harmonisation.


Apologies for any inconvenience that this short down-time may cause.
