Dear JASMIN users,


The /work/scratch-nompiio volume will be purged on **Wednesday 27th May** to empty it and reprovision it with a new fixed quota of 90TB (from 120TB).


Any important data should be moved to a group workspace so that you do not lose it.   
We urge users to start moving the data from the /work/scratch-nompiio as soon as possible.


The /work/scratch-nompiio will be unavailable for the duration of the purge - the duration is yet to be announced. Please do not run batch jobs that write/read to /work/scratch-nompiio, as your job will fail.


**This change will affect nearly all JASMIN users so please take note!**


JASMIN Team
