This message includes information about the following:


1. Update on SLURM & CentOS7 LOTUS cluster
2. New CentOS7 scientific servers for SLURM job submission
3. New documentation on LOTUS/SLURM
4. New CentOS7 "copy service" using LOTUS


**Important reminder about the timescale: the current batch system will be unavailable after the end of June 2020.** After this, users will be expected to use SLURM.


=== Updates ===


1. A sub-cluster of LOTUS with the CentOS7 systems, and managed by the new batch scheduler SLURM, is now available for initial testing using the following SLURM queues (partitions): ‘short-serial’ and ‘test’.


2. The new CentOS7 scientific analysis servers for SLURM job submission are: "sci2-test.jasmin.ac.uk", "sci4-test.jasmin.ac.uk", "sci5-test.jasmin.ac.uk".


Further information about the “sci” servers can be found here: <https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4859-centos7-sci-login-xfer-servers> 


3. New documentation on SLURM and the mapping between SLURM & LSF can be found here:  <https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/category/4889-slurm>  (documentation is in progress)


4. A new CentOS7 "copy service" is available to test from the new CentOS7 sci[4,5].jasmin.ac.uk. Further details on the copy service can be found here: <https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/3844-copy-service> 


**Plans for updates to mass-cli1 and jasmin-cylc servers:** We are currently working on replacements for the "mass-cli1" and "jasmin-cylc" servers. More information about the new configurations will be provided in future communications. 


For SLURM/LOTUS webinar, and training materials, further details will be provided in due course.


Previous announcements on this topic are detailed here: <http://www.jasmin.ac.uk/articles/vm-migration/> 


Thank you for your attention and please look out for further updates as this work progresses.
