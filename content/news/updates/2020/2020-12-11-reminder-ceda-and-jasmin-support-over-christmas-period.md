A reminder there is a "change freeze" in place from 17:00 today. Requests for new or changes to existing services will not be dealt with until the New Year.
  
Please also note that CEDA and JASMIN services should be considered to be running “at-risk” from 17:00 on Thursday 17th December to Monday 4th January 2021, with little or no helpdesk service available during this period. 
 
Further details can be found on our [earlier announcement here](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/ceda-and-jasmin-support-over-christmas-period/).
