We are pleased to announce the release of a new JASMIN service providing access to Jupyter notebooks.   
  



**What is the JASMIN Notebook service?**  
The [JASMIN Notebook service](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4851-jasmin-notebook-service) provides access to [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in the web browser. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document containing live code and visualisations that can be viewed and modified in a web browser. These documents can be shared, often using GitHub, and many projects distribute example code as Jupyter notebooks. Users interact with their notebooks using the open-source Jupyter Notebook server application.  
  



**What can you use it for?**


This service is primarily intended for interactively producing visualisations of existing data using Python. Your notebooks have read-only access to all the archive and GWS data you can access from the JASMIN Scientific Analysis servers. Using a web browser means that you can iterate quickly on plots without having to move image files around. Previously, the only way to look at visualisations you made on JASMIN was to copy them to your machine or use X11 Forwarding - with the new Notebook service, you no longer have to do this.   
  



**Limitations**


This service is currently in a beta/testing phase - meaning access to the service is limited and unknown issues/bugs in the software may be present. During this phase of the service, only 50 concurrent accesses to the service will be allowed at any one time. If this limit is reached, you will not be able to access the service until the number of accesses reduces.   
  



As this service is new, please also be understanding if there are teething issues. We hope this service will be useful to users and would love to hear about your experience of using the service. We welcome any feedback and/or improvements to the service and its help documentation.
