Dear all,


We are experiencing extremely high numbers of helpdesk queries on the JASMIN helpdesk and now have a significant backlog.


This has been caused by the transition to SLURM and the changes to the software stack on the new Centos7 machines. We are aware that these essential updates are causing difficulties for many users.


We are a small team, with very unique specialist expertise about the services we run. This expertise is frequently limited to just one or two members of staff. When large scale issues like this occur, unfortunately, there are only a few members of staff with the appropriate expertise to help resolve the issues. The backlog has also been exacerbated by staff absence and staff time spent delivering and preparing for our recent online event (on 29/30th Sept).


We are doing our best to get through your issues as quickly as possible but unfortunately, at the moment we are likely to take longer to respond to you.


Please be assured that we are dealing with the queries as fast as we can. We apologise for the inevitable inconvenience caused.


Best wishes,   
JASMIN team
