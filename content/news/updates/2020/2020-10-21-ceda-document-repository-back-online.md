The CEDA Document Repository, a service to host supplementary information for items in the CEDA archive, has been made available once again following a hiatus in the service to allow it to be updated.  
  
New-depositor registration has been disabled in the latest version, though log-ins can be set up on request. Please contact the CEDA helpdesk for further assistance.  
  
Existing registered depositors may continue to submit new items as before.
