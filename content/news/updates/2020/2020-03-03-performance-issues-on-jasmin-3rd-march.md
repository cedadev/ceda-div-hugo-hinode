We are aware of some performance issues on JASMIN. We are currently investigating these issues and will provide updates via our news channel [here](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/).   
  
Please can we take this opportunity to remind you to familiarise yourself about best practice on using JASMIN (as previously shared in an email on 26th Feb and in a news item [here](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/performance-issues-on-jasmin/)).   
  
Best wishes,   
JASMIN team
