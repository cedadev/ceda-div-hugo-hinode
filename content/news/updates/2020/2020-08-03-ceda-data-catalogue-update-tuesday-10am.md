The CEDA Data Catalogue service will be briefly unavailable on Tuesday 4th August at 10am whilst some important updates to the service are rolled out.


Most of these updates will be behind the scenes to aid CEDA staff workflows and address a few minor bugs. Additionally, updates to the REST API endpoint to the CEDA data catalogue will also be rolled out which will allow developers greater interaction with the archive contents. If you are interested in finding out more about the REST API for the catalogue please contact us.


We hope that the service will be back online by 10.30 am at the latest.
