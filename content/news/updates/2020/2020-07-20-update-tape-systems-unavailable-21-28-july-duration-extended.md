Dear users,


Maintenance work previously announced for 22-24 July 2020 will add additional capacity to the tape library shared by CEDA and JASMIN tape services. The tape library, and hence all tape services: Elastic Tape (ET) and StorageD (SD) and Near Line Archive (NLA) will be unavailable for this period.


Please note that the unavailability period has now been extended to start from 17:00 on Tuesday 21st July until Monday 28th July (time TBC): users of these services should look out for an announcement that the service is ready for use again before attempting to access them.


Thanks in advance for your cooperation, and apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused.


JASMIN Team
