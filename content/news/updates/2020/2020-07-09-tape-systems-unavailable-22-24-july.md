Dear users,


Maintenance work is planned for 22-24 July 2020 to add additional capacity to the tape library shared by CEDA and JASMIN tape services. The tape library, and hence all tape services: Elastic Tape (ET) and StorageD (SD) and Near Line Archive (NLA) will be unavailable for this period


We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.


JASMIN Team
