There will be no user support available via the CEDA helpdesk on Thursday 12th March, due to the team participating in an all-staff away day. This means user queries submitted to the helpdesk will not be answered on Thursday (and there may be a delayed response to queries submitted on Wednesday).   
  
All user queries received during this period will be answered as soon as possible from Friday 13th March. Please bear with us as it may take longer than usual to respond to the backlog of queries.   
  
Operational system support for JASMIN will still be in place during this period.   
  
CEDA and JASMIN services are supported on a best-efforts basis, you can find more information about what that means [here](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4470-ceda-helpdesk).   
  
Thank you in advance for your cooperation and understanding,  
CEDA/JASMIN team
