Dear JASMIN user,  
  
The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the benchmark work. The SLURM batch reservation will start on **Saturday 17th October from 4 PM to 8 PM**. Any job submitted before that time with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished. Note: jobs submitted to the long-serial queue may be affected.  
  
Thank you for your cooperation  
JASMIN team
