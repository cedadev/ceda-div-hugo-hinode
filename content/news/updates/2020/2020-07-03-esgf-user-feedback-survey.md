We would like to announce the launch of the [ESGF](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/) user feedback survey 2020.  
  
This infrastructure-focused survey aims to collect feedback from a broad range of ESGF users, CMIP6 modeling groups contributing data, CMIP6 MIP-chairs who have requested data, as well as the broader community of CMIP data users and stakeholders. The results of the survey will focus the development priorities for the next-generation ESGF software stack and website, along with the ESGF computing capabilities to be launched soon alongside the data.  
  
This infrastructure-focused survey is being led by the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) in collaboration IS-ENES with the [WCRP WGCM Infrastructure Panel](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wip) to “take the temperature” of how CMIP data contributors, users, and stakeholders are working with ESGF to search, access and download data. We expect another science-focused survey led by the CMIP panel and focused on the possible design of CMIP7 will follow in a number of months.  
  
**The survey will take 10-15 minutes of your time, and is available at****<https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3RZFPG7>****We appreciate it if you can respond before Monday 20th August 2020.**We invite you to forward the details far and wide so that we can collate the most representative feedback for ESGF’s broad contributor and user communities.
