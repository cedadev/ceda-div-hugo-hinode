A quirk in the data catalogue admin interface has recently come to light concerning time zones and entering temporal extent on some records.


To address the underlying cause, the catalogue service will be offline for a short time at 1600 today, but considered at-risk until 1630.


We will be identifying and addressing known incorrect temporal extents, but users are welcome to flag other suspicious values to the helpdesk for us to check.


Apologies for any inconvenience caused.  
CEDA Team.
