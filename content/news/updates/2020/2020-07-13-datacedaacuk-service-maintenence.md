The update to [data.ceda.ac.uk](http://data.ceda.ac.uk/) is now completed. We apologise for a longer than expected downtime, this was caused by a slow network connection.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We will be switching the data browser to use a different data source as part of the CentOS migration. Short downtime from Tuesday 14th 9:30am. At risk until 10:00am.


We apologise for any inconveniences  
CEDA Team
