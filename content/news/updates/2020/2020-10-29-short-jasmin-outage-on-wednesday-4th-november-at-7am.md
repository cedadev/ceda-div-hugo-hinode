Dear Users,  
  
JASMINâ€™s host institute at RAL are planning some short breaks in connectivity for a site wide firewall firmware upgrade. This will affect all access to JASMIN - except the DTZ machines and external cloud.  
  
The work is planned for 7am on Wednesday 4th November and should be considered at risk from 7am until 9am. However, if the work takes longer then it will affect JASMIN services.  
  
We apologise for any inconvenience caused.  
  
Kind regards  
JASMIN Team
