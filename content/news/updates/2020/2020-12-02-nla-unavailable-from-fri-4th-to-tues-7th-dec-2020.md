The Near-Line Archive (NLA) tape system will be unavailable from the evening of Friday the 4th December until Monday the 7th December 2020.  
No new retrievals will be accepted from the evening of Friday 4th December, so as to allow any remaining retrievals to finish over the weekend.


During the downtime the StorageD tape server will be upgraded. The NLA relies upon this server to make retrievals from tape.


We apologise in advance for any inconvenience caused.
