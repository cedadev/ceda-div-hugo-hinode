Dear JASMIN users,


We are aware that users are experiencing difficulties with performance and access to some resources on JASMIN at present. This is due to a problem with one of the storage servers.  
 This will affect the performance of Group Workspaces under the path /gws/nopw/j04 - we believe that small files (<64KB) and symbolic links are more likely to be affected.


We are working on fixing the problem with the storage server, but because of the current constraints due to Covid-19 lockdown, the timeline to address this issue could be by the end of next week or later.


Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.


JASMIN team
