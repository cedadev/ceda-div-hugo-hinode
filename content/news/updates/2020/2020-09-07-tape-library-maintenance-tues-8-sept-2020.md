Maintenance work on the Spectra tape library is now planned for tomorrow Tuesday 8th September, which may mean a delay to tape retrievals with Elastic Tape (ET) and Near-Line Archive (NLA) services.


The work will involve running diagnostics on some of the tape drives and will likely involve switching certain drives off for up to 2 hours before bringing them back online. The exact timing of any interruptions to the service(s) is not yet known, however any retrievals delayed by the work will be queued and processed when the library is back online later in the day.


Apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused.
