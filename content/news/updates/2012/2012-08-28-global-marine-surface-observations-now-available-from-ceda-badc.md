The Met Office MIDAS dataset held at the BADC has been updated to now include global marine surface observation data (e.g. buoy and ship measurements).


More information about this new part of the MIDAS archive is available at:


<http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/badc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__ACTIVITY_59c9d818-e0a0-11e1-a8da-00163e251233>


The Marine observations currently span the time period of 1990 to present date.


Parameters include offshore wind speed and direction, present and past weather, Cloud characteritics (amount, type, base amount, base height), Pressure (mean sea level), Visibility, Temperature (air, dew-point, wetbulb, sea), Relative humidity, Wave (direction, period, height), Wind-wave (period, height), Swell (direction, -wave period, height), Maximum gust speed and period.


The Met Office MIDAS data, including the Global Marine Observations, are restricted to academic research only. Please follow the link above for details of conditions of use.
