SERVICE PROBLEM: WPS hardware failure


Please note that due to a hardware failure the WPS is currently unable to run offline jobs. Please refrain from submitting jobs until further notice.  
We are looking at the problem and we will post a news item here and on the CEDA WPS interface as soon as it has been resolved.


Thank you for your patience.
