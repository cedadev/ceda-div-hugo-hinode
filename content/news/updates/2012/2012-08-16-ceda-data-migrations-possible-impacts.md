With the deployment of CEDA's new storage architecture have been successfully completed at the start of the year CEDA is presently migrating its data holdings over from the present NAS systems to the new storage. While the majority of this process should not affect CEDA services and data access there is the possibility for disruption to some services from time to time.


CEDA will endeavour to resolve any issues that arise as quickly as possible to minimise any disruption to our users.


Any significant planned outages will still be flagged to our users in advance through further news item posting where this is possible.
