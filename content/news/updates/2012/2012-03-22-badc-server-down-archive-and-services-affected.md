Following system disk problems, about 75% of the BADC and NEODC archive is unfortunately temporarily unavailable. This includes, among others, the following datasets and associated services:


* Met Office MIDAS data and CEDA WPS
* CRU TS 3.0 and 3.1 data
* ECMWF Operational analyses, Data Extractor Service and Trajectory Service
* FAAM archive
* Met Office HadISST data
* NEXTMap data


We are working at restoring access to the affected datasets as soon as possible.


We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.
