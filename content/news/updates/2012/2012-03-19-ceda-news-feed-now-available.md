The Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) runs both the British Atmospheric and NERC Earth Observation data centres  - the [BADC](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk "Link to BADC website") and [NEODC](http://www.neodc.rl.ac.uk "Link to NEODC website").


To improve CEDA's delivery of news relevant to our user community and recognising the increasing cross-over between the BADC and NEODC user communities CEDA has now combined the seperate news feeds for the BADC and NEODC. 


Users are invited to sign up to this new CEDA News feed, available both as [RSS](/no-longer-available "Link to CEDA RSS feed") and [ATOM](/no-longer-available "Link to CEDA Atom Feed") feeds, where they will receive timely news items announcing:



* release of new datasets
* important service announcements
* planned maintence
* server issues affecting data access


All previous BADC and NEODC news items are availalbe in the CEDA blog history which users are welcome to browse.
