Each year the CEDA's parent organisation, the Science and Technology Facilities Council, welcomes over 100 work experience students aged 14 -17 years of age. The work experience scheme is presently open for applications for the 2013 work experience Â programme, with placements available between April and August 2013. Interested students are invited to apply via the [STFC website](http://www.stfc.ac.uk/Public+and+Schools/2594.aspx "STFC Work Experience Scheme").


**Application deadline is 31st December.**


CEDA's UKSSDC is looking to offer some work experience placements in 2013.
