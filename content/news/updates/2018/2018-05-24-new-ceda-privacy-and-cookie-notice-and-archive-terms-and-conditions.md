A new CEDA Privacy and Cookie Notice, which users can view [here](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4639-privacy-and-cookies "Link to new CEDA Privacy and Cookies Notice"), has been released. This aims to give greater clarity on how CEDA holds and makes use of user information.


Additionally, an updated set of CEDA Archive service Terms and Conditions have been released and can be viewed [here](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4640-ceda-archive-terms-and-conditions "New CEDA Archive Terms and Conditions").


Existing and new CEDA users do not need to undertake any action, but if you are a data user, data provider or a dataset application authoriser you should read the new Terms and Conditions and let us know if you no longer wish to use your CEDA User account in line with these. Similarly, we would like to invite users to review their account details and update as necessary.


Please contact the CEDA Help Desk for any further assistance.
