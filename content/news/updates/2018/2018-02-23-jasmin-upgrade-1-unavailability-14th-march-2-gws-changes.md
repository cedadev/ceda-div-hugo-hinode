1. JASMIN Unavailable Wednesday 14th March
2. Changes to Group Workspace storage


There will be a [major upgrade of JASMIN over the next few months](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk/phase4 "link to JASMIN phase 4 information"), more than doubling the available storage and adding significantly more compute. The upgrade will involve a rolling programme of data migration that will affect everyone.


The first installment of upgrades involves migration of home directories during which there will be no access to JASMIN. This will be followed by migration of data off storage that needs retirement - we will attempt to minimise the impact of the migration on users. 


1. JASMIN Home Directory migration Wednesday 14th March


User home directories will be moved to new storage on this date. Users will not be able to log in to JASMIN and many services may be unavailable between 07:00 and 19:00. Access to JASMIN Unmanaged Cloud tenancies should not be affected. This intervention has been timed to coincide with scheduled maintenance on the RAL Site Firewall which will cause a break in connectivity between 07:00 and 07:30 on the same day. CEDA may also take the opportunity to undertake scheduled maintenance to internal services.


2. Changes to JASMIN Group Workspace Storage  
  
All group workspaces with paths /group\_workspaces/jasmin and /group\_workspaces/cems (not jasmin2 or cems2) will be migrated to new storage over the coming weeks. The most important issue for users to recognise is that the paths to their GWS will change. During the change, there may be short interruptions to service on a “per-GWS” basis. Some of the new storage is using a new technology, and will not support shared file writes with MPI-IO - if you think this might be a problem for you, please contact the JASMIN support team via the CEDA Helpdesk (support@ceda.ac.uk). If you are a GWS manager, please find further details [here](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk/phase4 "Link to phase 4 GWS information") as to how this will affect you and your users.


  
We thank you in advance for your cooperation with these changes while the next generation of JASMIN technology is brought into operation.
