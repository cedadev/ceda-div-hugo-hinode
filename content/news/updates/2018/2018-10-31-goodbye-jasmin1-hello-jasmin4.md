After six years of faithful service, the last 4.5 Petabytes of JASMIN1 Panasis storage has undergone its final secure erase, ready for decommissioning. This is one of the many steps being undertaken during JASMIN Phase 4 which will see the capacity increase to over 44PB by the end of 2018. Examples of this ongoing work include:


* **New faster home directory and scratch storage**


* *38.5 PB of new storage for group workspaces and the CEDA Archive*


* *Over 1000 new cores for JASMIN’s batch computing cluster, LOTUS*


* *Innovative data access services and cloud computing capabilities*


 


Detailed information about how these updates affect users can be found [here](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk/phase4/).


Although we are excited to see JASMIN continually grow and develop, saying goodbye to the first pieces of hardware that enabled JASMIN’s existence is the end of an era. Farewell JASMIN1, our faithful friend. Best wishes in your computer recycling retirement...
