Delays in setting up new BADC user accounts
===========================================

Due to the Royal Mail Strike in Oxfordshire, no mail has been delivered to 
the BADC for the past 7 days.

This unfortunately implies that no applications for new BADC Accounts have 
been delivered to the BADC for the past 7 days and nobody knows how long 
it will last. Consequently there will be delays in setting up accounts for 
new BADC users.

However, if you wish to access restricted data in earnest, please contact the 
BADC Support at badc@rl.ac.uk .

 
We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.


BADC Support 15/08/00.
