GISST2.3 Data have had to be replaced
=====================================

The UK Met. Office has recently discovered an error in their reformat-to-send-out program 
which has made a difference of 1 in the second decimal place of the GISST dataset we hold. 
The difference is negligible but to be consistent, the BADC replaced all the GISST files
with the correct version 2.3 provided by the UK Met. Office. 
10 years gzipped data files as provided by the UK Met. Office have also been made available.

Note that the GICE data are unaffected.

We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.


BADC Support 12/07/00.
