BADC Searchable Catalogues temporarily unavailable
===================================================

Due to database problems, the BADC Datasets catalogue (including the ACSOE
catalogue) is temporarily unavailable.  
For the time being, please use the link to [List of all datasets in BADC catalogue](/data/dataset_index). Please note that the link to
*Catalogue Record* is not available due to the same problems. 

For the same reason, the UKMO Station catalogue is also temporarily unavailable.
For the time being, please use the link to [List of Station names and numbers](/data/surface/station_lists/midas_stations.html).

We are now working on the problem and hope to restore access to these services
as soon as possible. We will let you know when the catalogues are back online. 
We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.


BADC Support 28/02/00.
