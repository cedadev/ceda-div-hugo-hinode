GERB data is now available from the BADC.
=========================================
Data from the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument is now 
available at the BADC.

The GERB instrument makes accurate measurements of the Earth Radiation Budget. 
It is specifically designed to be mounted on a geostationary satellite and is 
carried onboard the Meteosat Second Generation satellite operated by EUMETSAT. 
It has been produced by a European consortium led by the UK together with 
Belgium, Italy, and EUMETSAT, with funding from national agencies. The first 
GERB instrument, GERB-2, was onboard Meteosat Second Generation satellite, 
MSG-1, and began transmitting data on 12th December 2002. GERB-1 was launched 
onboard MSG-2 on 21st December 2005 and is now operational. 

The BADC GERB archive contains the latest version or "Edition" of data 
released for distribution by the GERB team. The initial data release contains 
a few weeks of Edition data from 25 March to 15 August 2006. Further data will 
be archived as it is reprocessed and becomes available.  This data is available
to academic researchers. 

See the web page <http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/gerb/> for further details.
