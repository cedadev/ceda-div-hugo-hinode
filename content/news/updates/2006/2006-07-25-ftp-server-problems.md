Recent Server Problems at BADC Are Now Being Resolved
=====================================================

On Friday 21st July the BADC suffered a hardware failure which affected FTP services.
The hardware has been fixed and most related issues have been resolved, so service is
returning to normal.

There remains an issue with the incoming FTP directories, from which data was lost.  If 
you submitted data which you fear was lost, please check the archive and contact BADC if
you find a problem.  At the time of writing, access to the incoming directories has not
been fully restored, but this should follow soon.
