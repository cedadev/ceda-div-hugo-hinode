EUMETSAT has announced the termination of satellite image transmission from Meteosat 7 
from 0o longitude as of 0900 UTC on 14th June 2006. This ends the provision of 0o 
longitude services from the first generation of Meteosat. An archive of past images is 
still publicly available at the BADC extending back to November 1999.


 
The provision of the operational 0o service is continued by Meteosat Second Generation 
(MSG satellites, Meteosat-8 and Meteosat-9). Images and data\* from Meteosat 8 are 
currently available at the BADC (\*some are public, some have access restrictions).
