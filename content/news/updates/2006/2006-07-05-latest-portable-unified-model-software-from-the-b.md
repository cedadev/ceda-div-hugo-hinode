 The Met Office Portable Unified Model (PUM) software **version 6.1** is now available from the BADC. Access must be granted separately for each version, so you should apply for access following the link on the dataset webpage, under 'Restricted Source Code'. See <http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk/data/pum/> . The code itself is located in the software directory of the PUM dataset directory (/badc/ukmo-pum/software).
