New releases of Jaspy and JasR are now available on JASMIN, on the `sci` machines and LOTUS. They can be loaded using `module load jaspy/3.12/v20250704` or `module load jasr/4.4/v20250704` as appropriate.

On Tuesday 29th July, JASMIN maintenance day,  we will:

- make these the default versions that are obtained using `module load jaspy` and `module load jasr`.
- update the JASMIN Notebooks service to use the new Jaspy version
- remove the following old versions from the default module setup:
  - `jaspy/3.11/v20240815`
  - `jasr/4.3/v20240815`

Release notes are available for [the Jaspy and Jasr releases on GitHub](https://github.com/cedadev/ceda-jaspy-envs/releases/tag/jaspy3.12_v20250704).
