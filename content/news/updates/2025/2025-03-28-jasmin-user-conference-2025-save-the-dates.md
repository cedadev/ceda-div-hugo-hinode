We will be hosting the next JASMIN conference at RAL on the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire on **Tuesday 10th and Wednesday 11th June 2025**.

The purpose of the conference is to:

- Share important updates from the JASMIN team about current services and developments
- Strengthen the community and enable sharing of experience and expertise
- Get feedback from users and provide an opportunity for discussion

Over 2 days there will be a mixture of talks from user projects and from the JASMIN team, discussions,  networking time and opportunities to learn about new services.
