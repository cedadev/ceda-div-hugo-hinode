We have reluctantly taken the decision NOT to go ahead with the current plan for the JASMIN User Conference scheduled for 1-2 October 2025. Low registration numbers meant that an in-person event was not viable in its planned format.

The team is currently in discussion about a series of webinars over coming weeks which will provide an alternative platform for presenting some of the conference material and opportunities for community discussion: please look out for further announcements.

We will also explore opportunities to link with other community events in the future.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused, and hope to see you at one or more of the events to follow.
