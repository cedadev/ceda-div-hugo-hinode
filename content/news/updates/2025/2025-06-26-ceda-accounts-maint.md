This morning, the 26th June, until midday (12pm), we will be rolling out some improvements to our CEDA account management services. During this time, there may be disruption to some website functions, including sign up for new CEDA accounts and account management operations such as password reset. Once completed, these updates should result in a better user experience while managing your CEDA account.
