After a review of our FTP service following a security incident at the end of 2024 we have decided that we will no longer support authenticated FTP access to restricted data in the CEDA Archive via ftp.ceda.ac.uk.

We will continue to provide {{<link "https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/280-ftp" >}} anonymous FTP access {{</link>}} to selected data via anon-ftp.ceda.ac.uk.  

If you previously used authenticated FTP to access our archives, please see {{<link "https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4431-ceda-archive-web-download-and-services" >}} the CEDA Archive web download service {{</link>}} for alternative ways of downloading data.

The most suitable alternative to FTP is most likely {{<link "https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/5191-downloading-multiple-files-with-wget" >}} WGET {{</link>}}.

{{<link "https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/5191-downloading-multiple-files-with-wget" >}} Please click here for instructions on using WGET {{</link>}}.

We apologise for any inconvenience this causes. If you need any help, please contact support@ceda.ac.uk.
