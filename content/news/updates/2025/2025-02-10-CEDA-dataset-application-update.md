On Tuesday 11th February, starting from 10am and continuing all day, we will be rolling out a number of improvements to the way dataset access applications and authorisations are managed for CEDA accounts. During this time, some CEDA account features will be inaccessible. These include sign up for datasets, usersâ€™ dataset overview pages, and JASMIN account linking.

This service roll out will bring improved workflows for users, authorisers and CEDA staff, building on the success of a similar system employed for JASMIN service access. For CEDA users the changes are largely cosmetic, whilst for authorisers there will be a new portal for processing applications. Details on the new system {{<link "https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/5178-ceda-services-portal-guide-for-dataset-managers" >}} are available on our associated help page {{</link>}} for authorisers.

Once we have confirmed that the rollout has been successful, we will update {{<link status >}} our status page {{</link>}}, letting you know that everything is working again.
