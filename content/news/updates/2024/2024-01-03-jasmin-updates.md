We wish a happy new year to all our users.

Please note the following updates for your attention:

1. LOTUS throughput/capacity is currently slightly reduced while network switch maintenance is carried out. By a process of gradual rack-draining, compute nodes in each rack will be in `maint` state when viewed in SLURM node information e.g. `sinfo`
2.  Scheduled maintenance is planned for Tuesday 16th January  2024, which will cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services. Systems will be “at risk” and may be unavailable for all or part of the day. Other system work is also scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption.
The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 05:00x on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.

3. A reminder about our community discussion forum:  If you have useful tips or topics for discussion, feel free to contribute to the discussions taking shape over at our new "jasmin-community" area here (you'll need a Github account to post).

Thank you for your attention and please look out for further updates as this work progresses.
