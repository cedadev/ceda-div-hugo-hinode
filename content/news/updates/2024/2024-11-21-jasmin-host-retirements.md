## Upcoming host retirements

As part of our [current migration to the Rocky 9 operating system](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/software-on-jasmin/rocky9-migration-2024/#details-of-the-new-rocky-linux-9-environment), the following timetable of host retirements is planned.

Please take action NOW to move your work to the new hosts detailed here which replace these old hosts.
We will try and provide further reminders 1 week then 1 day in advance of each group of retirements.
Retirements marked for today have already been advertised to affected users.

Please check back regularly {{<link "https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/software-on-jasmin/rocky9-migration-2024/#timetable-for-host-retirements">}}in this document{{</link>}} to keep up to date.

## Update on SOF storage issue

Unfortunately the issue is still ongoing, so intermittent problems persist with accessing the CEDA Archive and group workspaces
`/gws/nopow/j04/*` and some other volumes. The infrastructure team is working hard with the storage vendor to try to resolve the
issue. Please refer to the CEDA Status Board to keep track of latest updates.

With apologies for any inconvenience caused,

JASMIN Team
