Dear Users,

I would like to remind you that the survey on the JASMIN Cloud is still open. We have decided to close the survey on 28th Feb. It would be incredibly helpful to get the communityâ€™s input on the future of the JASMIN Cloud, so please consider spending the time to fill in the survey - it should take less than 10 mins to complete.

We have recently been informed that our cloud platform VMWare Integrated OpenStack (VIO) is being discontinued. This presents us with an opportunity to make decisions on the direction which we want to take the JASMIN Cloud. The timescale for this is by mid 2025.

We would like to ask all JASMIN Users to take the following short survey about the JASMIN Cloud so that we can gather information about why you do or do not use the cloud and about any features which you would like to see.

Also, we would specifically like to hear what existing tenants are using the cloud for so that we can capture those requirements.

If there are any questions about the survey, please feel free to email the JASMIN Helpdesk.

Thanks
JASMIN Team
