The CEDA data catalogue will be temporarily down at 4pm today to allow for an update to be rolled out to enhance our content harvesting by Google to aid wider discoverability of the data in the CEDA archive. We hope that this brief interruption will be kept as short as possible.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
CEDA Team.
