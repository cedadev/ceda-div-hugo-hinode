Dear Users,

We are aware of intermittent issues affecting users using our data download web service (data.ceda.ac.uk) at present. This will occasionally present users with an 'Internal Error' page. This can usually be addressed by refreshing the page.

We have identified the underlying cause of this problem and working with colleagues to get this resolved as soon as possible.
FTP downloads and direct access on the JASMIN machines are unaffected.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.

CEDA Team
