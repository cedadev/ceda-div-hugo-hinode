{{<alert type="info">}}Issues now resolved, please report any further problems.{{</alert>}}

Further problems occurred over the weekend with JASMINâ€™s SOF storage, used for `/gws/nopw/j04/*`` group workspaces and the CEDA Archive. With LOTUS batch cluster jobs failing for this reason, hosts have been removed from the cluster for the time being.

The root cause of the problem has been identified and work is currently underway to resolve it.

Please also be aware of the maintenance period previously announced for JASMIN and related tape services (ET, JDMA, and NLA)

* Mon 22/Tues 23 Jan: tape services closed for software upgrade

Please refer to the {{<link "ceda_status">}}CEDA status{{</link>}} page for updates on each of these.

With apologies for any inconvenience.
JASMIN Team
