Dear Users,

We have some exciting JASMIN-related updates to share with you:

##### The JASMIN User Seminar Series is back!

We are restarting the JASMIN user seminar series on __Tuesday February 6th at 1pm!__ The format will be an online presentation from two JASMIN users for 20 minutes each followed by a Q&A session. Further details and joining instructions will be circulated by email.

{{< link "../../../events/past/JASMIN-user-seminar-series.md" >}} You can catch up on previous JASMIN seminars here. {{< /link >}}

##### JASMIN Conference Recordings

All the slides and video recordings from the JASMIN User Conference 2023 are now available to watch and browse. {{< link "../../../events/past/jasmin-conference-2023.md" >}} Links to all these are available on our event page here. {{< /link >}}

These include updates on the latest tools and services you can use with JASMIN and exciting highlight sessions where users share their work with and on JASMIN.

We also have the results from our discussion sessions where we asked what people liked about JASMIN and what people want to see more of in the future. {{< link "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iJblG7e3_72V91ZSQslRG-NNzwQDyFfWR7slYqrzPgE/edit?usp=sharing" >}} You can read those comments here. {{< /link >}}

There were also discussions about how we can make the running of JASMIN more sustainable. We are always looking for ways we can reduce our environmental impact. {{< link "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VWzEmWOxD3MvXRCgheR0AD2VhE9EllqmXrmc_7cfF6Y/edit?usp=sharing" >}}
You can read the summary of those conversations here. {{< /link >}}

##### Discussion Forum

Finally, A reminder that we now have {{< link "https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-community/discussions" >}} a discussion forum for all JASMIN-related topics! {{< /link >}}

Here you can raise any concerns, get programming advice, suggest ideas, or just share something interesting that youâ€™re working on.

We hope you check out some of these great talks and look forward to seeing you at the JASMIN seminar on 6th February!
