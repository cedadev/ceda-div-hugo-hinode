#### Outline of the ITT

This ITT will bring successful data providers into the EODH programme as partners. They will provide:  

- linkage to existing commercial data streams through proven capabilities,  
- EODH software interfaces (adaptors) and automated access to archived data,  
- close working around data access improvements which can stimulate uptake including licensing , and  
- access to large, existing datasets of value for demonstration and pre-operational research and development.  

We also seek support for resilient access to public data streams access for the EODH and improvements in global/temporal coverage.  

The ideal applicants will further demonstrate in their bid, the capabilities for tasking, the development path for improved integrated search, registration and download facilities, and capacities for new data streams. This ITT is focussed on obtaining access to high resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets.  

The total budget for the ITT, shared across up to __two__ providers, is between £0.85 million and £1.15 million including VAT.
