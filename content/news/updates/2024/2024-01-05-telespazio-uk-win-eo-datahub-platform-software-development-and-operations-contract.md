We are pleased to announce the winner of the EO DataHub Platform Software Development and Operations ITT– {{< link href="https://telespazio.co.uk/en/" >}} Telespazio UK, a subsidiary of Telespazio (a joint venture between Leonardo, 67%, and Thales, 33%). {{< /link >}}  The EODH team are excited to start the development process of the new data platform with one of Europe’s leading players in space applications and services.

The new {{< link href="https://eodatahub.org.uk/" >}} EO DataHub {{< /link >}} Platform is expected to assist application developers and Earth Observation experts to find, access, analyse and process EO data from multiple distributed sources in a consistent format with easy access for the end-user community. We trust that Telespazio UK will be successful in the delivery and operation of the platform for all of our users.

__Professor John Remedios, Executive Director of the National Centre for Earth Observation, said:__ *“I am delighted with the interest from industry in supporting the EO Data Hub in the UK. Our process has shown the high quality of UK capabilities and the significance of data infrastructure for markets and commercial activity. Telespazio UK will be an excellent partner in the UK’s Data Hub and we welcome them to the project as an expert company with considerable connectivity to the UK and international Earth Observation sectors.”*

__Dr Geoff Busswell, Head of Marketing & Sales for Telespazio UK, said:__ *“The EO Data Hub is a major step forward for the UK in developing a national capability for the community that can help business and research stakeholders create EO-based market impact. Telespazio UK is excited to bring to bear its deep expertise in hosted data management and big data platform open-source standards in the frame of major Copernicus and ESA programmes. We very much look forward to working with the Core Team to create an interoperable and sustainable EO Data Hub we can be proud of in the UK.”*

__Philip Kershaw, Head of the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis, said:__ *“The award of this contract marks a major milestone in the EO Data Hub, a project which has been funded through NERC as part of DSIT’s EO Investment Package. We look forward to working with our industry partners on the development of the Hub Platform, a core component of the overall system.”*

This award is the beginning of exciting opportunities within the EODH programme. We have recently launched the Invitation to Tender (ITT) for the EO DataHub Applications and Integrations contract. This ITT’s implementation will mark an important step forward in adding user-orientated service interfaces to the core Hub Platform software. The successful applicants will be expected to work closely with the Platform Development and Operations team for a successful delivery. There are three applications for the ITT which can be applied for as a whole or individually:

__Lot 1:__ Web-application delivering Combined Information from Climate Observations and Projections;

__Lot 2:__ Web-map application showcasing Land Surface data provided through the EODH: responsive and fast “slippy-map” application providing browse, select, compare, visualise and processing capabilities;

__Lot 3:__ Open-source code integrations and training: accelerating use of the Hub Platform capabilities, with a focus on GIS practitioners, through firstly a software integration with an existing platform or software product and secondly a training course delivered through a collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks.
