The National Centre for Atmospheric Science **(NCAS)** are hosting the first Harmony in the Skies: Bridging Horizons in Atmospheric Science symposium for the early career atmospheric science community!

The forum will take place on Wednesday 20th - Thursday 21st March 2024 in Leeds, at Fairbairn House, NCAS headquarters.  Please register by Wednesday 21st February 2024!

The programming committee encourages anyone within NCAS who is early in their atmospheric science career to attend, especially if they would value the opportunity to:

- Develop their network and meet others who are establishing themselves in the atmospheric science community
- Share best practices within and beyond NCAS and showcase the benefits of a cross-institution research centre

This event is for NCAS training course alumni and anyone early in their atmospheric science career - not just researchers. It is free to attend and accommodation will be provided for all delegates on Wednesday 20 March.  NCAS staff travel can be covered by local NCAS budgets.

The event will provide a forum for sharing ideas and best practices to ensure that the science we do is sustainable and inclusive - through a series of workshops, short talks, discussions, and knowledge sharing opportunities.
We welcome your contributions. Abstracts for short talks or demonstrations are encouraged on any theme linked to work in atmospheric science - from research, to practical implementations of tools, or case studies.  

Please register, and submit abstracts, by Wednesday 21 February 2024.
