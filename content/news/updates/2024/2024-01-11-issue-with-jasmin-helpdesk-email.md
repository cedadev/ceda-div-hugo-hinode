We are aware that some users are unable to email into the JASMIN support mail box at present (support@jasmin.ac.uk).

We have raised the issue with our host institution to hopefully resolve this issue as quickly as possible.
In the meanwhile users can get in touch either by using the help beacon located on JASMIN web pages (bottom right corner) or by emailing support@ceda.ac.uk.

Outgoing mail from our help desk is unaffected.

Apologies for the inconvenience this is presently causing.

CEDA and JASMIN teams.
