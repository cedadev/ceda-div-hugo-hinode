The CEDA Data Catalogue will be undergoing maintenance from 3:00 pm until 5:00 pm today, Wednesday the 10th of July. During this time, the service may go offline, and some content may be unavailable.

As part of the maintenance, we are rolling out some improvements to the look-and-feel of the service, and weâ€™re aiming to speed up page load times and general responsiveness. Updates to the server backend will also allow us to roll-out future changes without needing to take the site down for maintenance in the future.
