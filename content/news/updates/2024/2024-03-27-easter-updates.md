Please note the following updates for your attention:

- CEDA and JASMIN support over the Easter period
- JASMIN regular scheduled maintenance Tuesday 16th April 2024
- Updated JASMIN dashboard now available
- Information for JASMIN cloud tenancy managers

1. As usual over the Easter period, CEDA and JASMIN services will be running at risk. Our helpdesks will be closed out of working hours and staff leave during the school holidays also means that staff levels after the Easter weekend may be reduced.

2. Scheduled maintenance is planned for **Tuesday 16th April  2024**, which will cause some disruption to JASMIN and CEDA services. Systems will be at risk and may be unavailable for all or part of the day. Other system work is also scheduled for this date in order to minimise disruption.
The LOTUS batch processing cluster will be unavailable for the duration of the work on the day, to avoid running jobs being adversely affected. A reservation will start at 05:00 am on the day, but any job submitted before that with a running time that goes over the reservation period will not start until after the reservation has finished.

3. We are pleased to announce that we have updated the JASMIN Metrics dashboards at https://mon.jasmin.ac.uk.  We have been working hard to update our metrics system including providing new dashboards for users.
Any JASMIN user can log into the dashboards using their JASMIN accounts portal credentials. Each page has a description about what it contains and a navigation box to access the other dashboards. The orange swirl Grafana symbol in the top left of the page will also take you back to the home page.
Currently metrics include: SOF, PFS, tape, power, with many more planned

4. Attention all managers of JASMIN Cloud tenancies: important information will follow in an separate announcement tomorrow.

Please continue to check the {{<link "ceda_status">}}status page{{</link>}} for detail on particular issues.

Thank you for your attention and best wishes from the CEDA and JASMIN teams.
