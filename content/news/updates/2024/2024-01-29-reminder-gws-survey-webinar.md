To: all JASMIN Group Workspace Managers

(please ignore if you are not involved in managing a GWS)

**Reminder to GWS Managers:** Please take a few minutes to complete our survey of Group Workspaces on JASMIN.

https://forms.office.com/e/rkUwGSMpvM

We are initiating this survey to examine the utilization of JASMIN group workspaces (GWSs). Storage is an expensive resource at the scale used within JASMIN and consumes significant energy. Your involvement is pivotal in helping us to understand how it is currently being used and how that could be improved.

**Please also attend our webinar on 8th February 2024 at 12:00** which will explain more about the survey and its aims and new tools available to GWS managers to help with managing their workspace(s).

As a GWS manager you may be managing more than one GWS. In such a case please complete a separate survey for each GWS that you are responsible for. Conversely, if several of you are responsible for one workspace, please coordinate with each other to submit **one response per workspace.**

Further information and instructions are provided at the survey link above.

**Thank you!** Your contribution will help us gain valuable insights into the usage of group workspace on JASMIN.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation,
JASMIN Team
