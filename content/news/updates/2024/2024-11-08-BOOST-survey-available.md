Dear Researchers,

We would like to {{< link "https://forms.gle/Yz1PhddwqEtPETgB7" >}} invite you to complete a survey to help us to improve the interoperability of data and data analysis platforms across all research domains. {{< /link >}}

The main aims of the survey are to:

- Identify platforms that you are currently using to analyse and produce new datasets
- Understand issues/barriers that you are facing using data from different domains
- Understand barriers to using different platforms
- Understand the type and range of analysis you wish to perform

This is part of the {{< link "https://eds.ukri.org/environmental-data-service" >}}  NERC Environmental Data Service{{< /link >}} BOOST project conducting work to develop a better understanding of how to improve access to data and tools. We will use the outcomes of the survey to inform recommendations to the {{< link "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology" >}} Department for Science Innovation and Technology {{< /link >}} on future work to improve the interoperability of UK research data.

Please {{< link "https://forms.gle/Yz1PhddwqEtPETgB7" >}} complete the survey {{< /link >}} by 30/11/2024. It will take approximately 15 minutes.
Should you have any questions about the survey please contact our helpdesk at support@ceda.ac.uk , including ‘BOOST Survey’ in the subject line.

Thank you for your time, we look forward to delving into your response.

Kind regards,
The BOOST EDS project team
