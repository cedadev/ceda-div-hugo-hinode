Last week, we announced that the Elastic Tape (ET) and JDMA services had resumed after an operating system upgrade.

Some additional points to note:

* ET users can continue to use the standard ET tools (et_get, et_put and et_ls).  Users can log in to et3.jasmin.ac.uk or etp2.jasmin.ac.uk

* **JDMA users will need to upgrade their client**.  Instructions for how to do this are here:

(JDMA is an easier-to-use command-line interface to the Elastic Tape servce, {{<link "https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/short-term-project-storage/jdma/">}}find out more here{{</link>}})
