**CEDA, on behalf of the EO DataHub, is delighted to announce the award of significant further contracts aimed at unlocking the potential of Earth Observation (EO) data and completing the team for this landmark project.**
These contracts represent a significant milestone in the collaboration between commercial technology providers, application developers and data sources to deliver a first digital national EO infrastructure.

The EO DataHub is a first step in modernising satellite data technologies for the UK for experts and non-experts alike. The overall goal of the project is to develop and operate a new centralised software infrastructure – DataHub – to provide a ‘single point’ of access for UK and international data offerings from distributed public and commercial sources. The system provides confidence for users through access to data processing, data quality checks and training from subject experts.

Led by the NERC National Centre for Earth Observation, at the Centre for Data Analysis (CEDA) and the University of Leicester, the team as shown is a unique combination of UKRI institutes, public sector establishments and commercial organisations who are known for their expert capabilities in EO data, computing and data quality systems. The new partners are:
