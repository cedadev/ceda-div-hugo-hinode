The current issue with {{<link href="https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/176-storage">}}JASMIN SOF storage{{{</link>}}} continues to affect many JASMIN and CEDA services.

The following services are affected:

- JASMIN:
  - Access to GWSs with paths /gws/nopw/j04/* are unavailable
  - LOTUS queues - you can send jobs, but they will be held in the queue until the issue is resolved
- Performance issues with sci machines and other hosts which mount the affected storage

- CEDA Archive:
  - No access to downloading data - you can search/find data on our website but you won’t be able to access the actual files

There is likely to be a knock-on effect to other aspects of the JASMIN system, so if something isn’t working, it is likely due to these issues. The cause has been identified and our team is working extremely hard (including out of hours) to resolve this.

Please do not contact the helpdesk. We will let you know any progress that is made today. We apologise for any inconveniences this may cause and thank you for your patience during this time.
