### Join us for a special event celebrating 30 years of the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis!

To celebrate 30 years of service in the environmental science community, we're having a celebration event on **Monday the 25th of November 2024!** At this event we will celebrate the past 30 years of innovation, growth, and collaboration at CEDA, showcase the depth and breadth of the work currently we do, and gather your feedback and ideas to shape the next 30 years.

----------------

30 years ago we saw the formal creation of the British Atmospheric Data Centre - {{< link nerc >}} NERC's {{< /link >}} designated data centre for the Atmospheric Sciences. Born out of the Geophysical Data Facility (GDF) and now known as the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), we have undergone huge changes over the past three decades. We are taking this opportunity not only to look back, but also to look ahead to the next 30 years.
