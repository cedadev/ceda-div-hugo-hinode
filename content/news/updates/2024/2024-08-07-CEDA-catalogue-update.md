The CEDA Data Catalogue Service will be updated from 3:30pm today, 7th August to aid harmonisation of services within CEDA and to improve access and licensing information on the catalogue records.

The main part of the update should be completed shortly after 3:30pm, but licence and access information may be temporarily unavailable during the update window until around 4:30 pm.
