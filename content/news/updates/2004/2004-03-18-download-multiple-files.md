We have recently updated the interface to our data archive to simplify the
process of downloading multiple files via the web. You can now select multiple
files from multiple directories for downloading as a single gzipped tar file. 

For more details, go to the 'Get Data' page (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/browse) and
click on 'How to use' in the Box labelled 'Download multiple files'.
