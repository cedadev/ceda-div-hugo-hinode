New ECMWF Seasonal Forecast (hindcast) Ensemble dataset
=======================================================

In support of the COAPEC Thematic Programme the BADC has extracted 
ECMWF Seasonal Forecast ensemble data. These data are also known 
as "Hindcasts" as they are forecasts run retrospectively.

The dataset includes monthly means, maxima, minima and standard 
deviations for the available surface variables for the period 
1987-2001 (with 2002 onwards currently being extracted). Atmospheric 
variables are only currently available as monthly means. 

There are 33 parameters held on surface or single levels including 
winds, temperatures, heat fluxes, radiation, precipitation and soil 
moisture. Geopotential, Temperature, Specific Humidity, Relative 
Vorticity and Divergence are available on pressure levels.

The data is held on a regular 1.875 x 1.875 degree grid in GRIB format.

For each month there are six forecast months archived, with 5 ensemble 
members for 10 months of the year, and 40 ensemble members in May and 
November of each year.

The data is now available to BADC users as part of the main ECMWF 
Operational archive with documentation located at:

  <http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ecmwf-op/seasonal_fcs.html>

Further documentation on the seasonal forecasts is available at the 
following ECMWF links:
