Met Office Wind Profiler data is now available from the BADC.
==============================================================================

In the late 1990's The Met Office purchased four boundary-layer wind-profilers 
(nominally 1 GHz), from Radian. The instruments are located at Camborne, 
Dunkeswell and Wattisham. The fourth was operated at the NERC MST Radar site at 
Capel Dewi, near Aberystwyth between November 1999 and March 2002; it has now 
been relocated to South Uist. 

Data from these instruments is now available at the BADC for the following 
dates: Camborne from 1998 to 2002, Dunkeswell from 1999 to 2002, and Wattisham 
from 2001 to 2002. Data from the fourth wind-profiler when it was located at 
Aberystwyth is also available.
