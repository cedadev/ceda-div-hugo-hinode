Beta test our new Data Extractor web-interface
==============================================

We are pleased to announce the launch of a test-version of the BADC Data Extractor (dx) 
- a web-interface to large datasets. You can access the Data Extractor if you are 
registered for any of the following datasets:

        ECMWF ERA-40
        ECMWF Operational data
        ECMWF ERA-15
        HiGEM
        COAPEC HadCM3 data

The Data Extractor exposes the following functionality to BADC users:

        Extraction of NetCDF datasets.
        Differencing between datasets.
        Browsing and selection of subsets.
        Selection in space and time.
        User-defined plotting.
        User-defined animation.

Please note that the current version (0.1b) is only a beta-release so we invite you to 
test the service and give us your feedback.
