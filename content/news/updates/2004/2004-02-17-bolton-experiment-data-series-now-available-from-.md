Bolton Experiment data now available at the BADC
================================================
The Bolton Experiment was a NERC project with matching funds from 
industry which took place between 1999 and 2002. 
The study tested the proposal that the difference in attenuation 
at two microwave frequencies along a given path can provide an 
accurate estimate of rainfall rate. 
The area selected for study was the town of Bolton in north-west
England.
