description: Our main goal is to ensure that atmospheric and earth observation data are made available and accessible to all in order to fully realise their reuse potential. We hold data covering climate, composition, observations and numerical weather prediction as well as various earth observation datasets, including airborne and satellite data and imagery.  JASMIN serves the scientific community by providing a range of computing services (batch, interactive, community cloud) and supporting a variety of data types in a scalable environment, as scientists bring their data to JASMIN.
