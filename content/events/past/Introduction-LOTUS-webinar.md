LOTUS is a JASMIN* service which enables efficient scheduling of large scale data analysis tasks. This is useful for researchers wanting to improve or change their workflows for carrying out tasks such as processing high resolution climate simulations, tracking tropical cyclones or other data intensive tasks.

<p><strong>Warning:&nbsp;The batch scheduler LSF was replaced by SLURM in 2020. The first principles of batch computing presented in these past webinars are still valid but the batch commands used are not and should be replaced by SLURM. Please refer to the webinar &lsquo;Transitioning&nbsp;&nbsp;to SLURM webinar'.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>This webinar introduces how JASMIN users can remotely access the LOTUS advanced computing resource, via the command line and the JASMIN scientific analysis platforms. The benefits of using LOTUS include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Large throughput of processing, means data analysis time can be significantly reduced</span></li>
<li><span>Access to large processing resources which aren't available in your home institutes/as an individual </span></li>
<li><span>Fair sharing of resources due to its intelligent scheduler LSF (Load Sharing Facility) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This&nbsp;webinar focussed on how researchers can use JASMIN's batch computing cluster; LOTUS. Covering the following topics: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When to use LOTUS </span></li>
<li><span>What is LOTUS </span></li>
<li><span>How to use LOTUS </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Anyone with an interest in changing the way they work on JASMIN can benefit from this webinar.&nbsp;</span></p>
