The PV 2018 Conference welcomes you to its 9th edition, to be held 15th – 17th May 2018 at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Space Cluster (UK ), hosted by the UK Space Agency and jointly organised by STFC, NCEO and the Satellite Applications Catapult.

For its ninth edition, the conference series moves to UKSA at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory part of the Harwell Space Cluster in the UK to continue addressing prospects in the domain of data preservation, stewardship and value adding of scientific data and research related information.

An end-to-end management approach for the long-term data preservation is key to ensure that there is no loss of information and data. It also entails the access to the archived data – including discovery, metadata, formats and interoperability considerations with the relevant standards – as well as the curation processes aimed at improving the information content and the usability of the archived data. In addition to emergent standards technologies and best practice, we would like to use this conference as an opportunity to explore issues of data management planning and archive appraisal.

We are also entering the era of big data; for this conference year, we would like to extend a special invite to large-scale scientific archives so we can facilitate discussion of emergent issues across scientific domains. As we move to a new and exciting technology age, we are seeing large-scale collaborations occurring on state of art virtual research environments and novel collaborative infrastructures. We would invite participation from projects, organisations or individuals developing novel data services within or as a result of these environments. This includes smaller bespoke archives wishing to integrate with larger data holdings to generate targeted knowledge and data services.

In <strong>PV2018</strong> we particularly welcome input from a broad range of science archives and data providers. In addition to <strong>space data archives</strong> we would like to extend a special invitation to.</li>
    <li><strong>Large science facilities</strong> from different domains to facilitate discussion of our common challenges.</li>
    <li><strong>Specialist science archives</strong> and <strong>data service providers</strong> who are integrating data with space based observation to <strong>produce innovative data services.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h4></h4>
    <h4>Session 1: Data stewardship approaches to ensure long-term data and knowledge preservation and data standards.</h4>
    <h6>Chairs: &nbsp;Brian Matthews, Richard Moreno, Harald Rothfuss and David Giaretta</h6>
    <p>In this session, we consider the best practises for the long-term preservation of the data and other results associated with research across the preservation lifecycle, from the submission of data packages for preservation, to the access of data products.&nbsp; This includes the organisational structures, policies and standards adopted by data centres and archives to assure cost-effective preservation, together with risk management, uncertainty quantification, quality assessment and the evaluation of preservation capabilities.&nbsp; Further, we will consider novel architectures and tools used to realise different preservation strategies, and standards, tools and languages to capture the preservation context, including the preservation of data formats, the use of identifiers, metadata, semantics, data provenance, quality and uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>
    <h6><strong>Topics for this session include:</strong></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Architectures and tools for curation and preservation</li>
    <li>Standards for preservation access and exploitation; including uncertainty and risk</li>
    <li>Policy, exploitation and preservation strategies</li>
    <li>Risk assessment and appraisal of data value</li>
    </ul>
    <h4></h4>
    <h4>Session 2: Adding value to data and facilitation of data use</h4>
    <div>
    <h6>Chairs: Tom Stein, Nancy Ritchey, Reta Beebe, Richard Hilton and Esther Conway</h6>
    <p>In this session, we consider activities that add value to archived data, facilitate their use or produce novel data services. Data archivists often focus most of their energy on creating well-formed, well-documented archives with the expectation that they will be available for the next 50 to 100 years. However, archived data are meaningless if they cannot be easily retrieved, understood, and used. As a result we would like to invite submissions from projects or archives who rising to the challenge of enhancing data in order to facilitate exploitation of data assets.</p>
    <h6><strong>Topics for this session include:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Added value services and applications on top of archives</li>
    <li>Techniques and tools for facilitating data access and use</li>
    <li>Approaches to supporting knowledge discovery</li>
    <li>Integrating user feedback into archives and repositories</li>
    <li>Validation and reanalysis of historic data sets</li>
    <li>Integration of new data sources and different types of data &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Return on investment for value add services</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Session 3 2017: Virtual Research Environments for science data exploitation and value adding</h4>
    <div>
    <h6>Chairs: Christophe Arviset, Mirko Albani, Phil Kershaw and Pascal Lecomte&nbsp;</h6>
    <p>This session will consider new challenges, activities and research related to Virtual Research Environments or Collaborative Environments. While Massive data growth is calling for a new paradigm, with a shift towards &ldquo;bring the user to the data", where scientists can bring their own code and run it where the data actually reside, instead of downloading the data and run their analysis on their computer. There is also an increased need for data, associated documentation and software long-term preservation and accessibility, for scientists to be able to re-run data analysis that was initially applied on the data. Last, scientists are now expecting to share not only their data, but also their software and the results of their research activities, and to work with their collaborators in an easy and effective manner, regardless of their location.</p>
    <h6><strong> Topics for this session include:</strong>&nbsp;</h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Thematic and science data exploitation platforms</li>
    <li>Collaborative virtual research environments</li>
    <li>Collaborative workflows and collection of data provenance</li>
    <li>Provision of software as a service, enabling software long term preservation and use</li>
    <li>Management of associated documentation management and data access</li>
    <li>Archival of data from shared environment</li>
    </ul>
    <h4></h4>
    <h4>Session 4: Data preservation in practice: past (present) and future</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h6>Chairs: Jamie Shiers, Kevin Ashley and Eberhard Mikusch</h6>
    <p>The purpose of this session is to examine existing practices and systems and highlight what has been learnt, including how to best benefit from collaboration between projects and/or disciplines. It will also look forward and attempt to understand how new developments and/or technologies and/or tomorrow's data volumes might influence or even constrain how things will be done in the future. Data preservation is not a static field: we wish to use this session to explore what we&nbsp;have learnt from previous migrations and to consider how to best prepare for the future, including potentially disruptive scenarios. We would also like to facilitate discussion on how different services involved in LTDP interplay and to use this opportunity to consider how we measure success and respond to requirements from funding agencies, such as those for F.A.I.R. data management.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <h6><strong>Topics for this session include:</strong></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Lessons from production systems, data curation, certification, migration between technologies, data re-use and sharing etc.</li>
    <li>Future outlook: the promise and threats resulting from new technologies including how to guard against disruptive changes. Archival preservation strategy heterogeneity or aiming for homogeneity.</li>
    <li>On-going or potential areas of cooperation in data preservation, access and reuse, including data transfer between and sharing across archives;</li>
    <li>What to preserve, balancing scientific, educational and cultural motivation in relation funding: now and in the longer term.</li>
    <li>Data at risk: examples of data not currently preserved or at risk for technical, financial or other reasons.</li>
