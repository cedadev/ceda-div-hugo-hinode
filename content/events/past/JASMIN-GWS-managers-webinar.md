Thank you all for attending the Groupworkspaces Managers Webinar which explained more about the GWS Managers survey and its aims and new tools available to GWS managers to help with managing their workspace(s).

The survey that was filled in prior to the webinar gave us some real insight into how managers are utilising their workspace(s).
We are grateful to everyone who was able to attend and we hope you were able to take something away from it.
