<p><span>CEDA regularly run hands-on interactive workshops for users of JASMIN.&nbsp;</span><span>Past e</span><span>vent details can be seen below. Resources used in the workshops can be found <a href="https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-workshop">here</a>.</span><br /><span></span></p>

<p>This hands-on workshop is aimed at novice to intermediate users of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.jasmin.ac.uk" target="_blank">JASMIN</a><span>&nbsp;</span>who wish to further their knowledge about efficiently working on JASMIN.&nbsp;We will cover a range of topics related to best practice for working on JASMIN. The workshop format will be via hands-on exercises and short presentations. Some example exercises include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1">Copying data to JASMIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"></span>Batch running scripts on LOTUS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Building your own Python 3 environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"></span>Optimising storage usage on JASMIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Managing a multi-step workflow</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that this hands-on, attendee driven workshop format will encourage interaction and collaboration between attendees and the JASMIN team. You can see the material from our last workshop<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-workshop" target="_blank">here</a>. We will largely cover the same topics but note it may change slightly.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>The one day workshop will take place</span>&nbsp;in a classroom&nbsp;<span>in Oxfordshire at CEDA's home institute - STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. We intend to cover the general exercises between 9.30-4pm, we will then cover some more advanced specialist topics between 4-6pm (e.g. Build your own Python3 environment, Compile and run parallel Fortran code on LOTUS). It is your choice whether you stay until 4pm or 6pm depending on your training requirements.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>The workshop will be delivered and supported by the JASMIN team (from both<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ceda.ac.uk" target="_blank">CEDA</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">SCD</a>), so is a great chance to interact, to discuss your research needs, and to provide feedback on the JASMIN service.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h5><span>Overall aims of the workshop:&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>To engage novice to intermediate users in best practice for working on JASMIN via hands-on exercises</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To increase understanding about:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>which parts of JASMIN are suited for different tasks</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>available software on JASMIN</span></p>
