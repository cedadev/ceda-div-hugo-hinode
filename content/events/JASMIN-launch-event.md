<h2>UK science community to benefit from major cloud computing and storage upgrade</h2>
<p>STFC and NERC today (2 June 2014) celebrate the completion of a major upgrade to the JASMIN data analysis infrastructure that plays a key role in the assessment and evaluation of huge sets of environmental data produced by the UK scientific community.</p>
<p>JASMIN has been designed for the Big Data challenges posed by 21st century environmental science and will expand its role as the infrastructure in which a plethora of science community services are run. The current upgrade will ensure a better understanding of, and a quicker response to, environmental change.</p>
<p>Run by STFC on behalf of NERC, JASMIN is based at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. It is half super-computer and half data-centre and as such provides a globally unique computational environment. It is responsible for two main functions: infrastructure for the data storage and services of the Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA), including the British Atmospheric Data Centre; and providing a platform for data-intensive scientific computation for the environmental science community.</p>
<p>Environmental science is benefiting from an exponential increase in data from new observing platforms &ndash; from sensor webs to Earth observation satellites. At the same time, increased computer power coupled with sophisticated mathematics, is opening up more environmental science to accurate simulation, which also generates vast quantities of data.</p>
<p>As a consequence, all environmental scientists face new infrastructural challenges. Recognising these challenges, STFC and NERC continue to invest in JASMIN &ndash; a massive world class facility to provide UK environmental science with a unique platform for data analysis.</p>
<p>Many datasets, particularly model data, are too big to be easily shipped around. JASMIN enables scientists to bring their processing to the data.</p>
