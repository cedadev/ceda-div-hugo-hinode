<p>This webinar&nbsp;provides&nbsp;an introduction to using Git and GitHub to manage, share and backup your code. We will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Why you should use version control </span></li>
<li><span>What GitHub is </span></li>
<li><span>How to get started with GitHub </span></li>
<li><span>Additional useful commands </span></li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the webinar you should be able to organise your code into a git repository and see it on GitHub along with knowing how to edit and update the repository. This will allow you to keep track of changes and easily share your code with others. This is a basic introduction, a more detailed look is found down below.</p>
<p><span>Within CEDA*, we use GitHub extensively to manage the code behind all our services; both internal and external. We are therefore well placed in providing support or answering any questions you may have about using GitHub for version control. </span></p>
<p><span>P</span><span>lease do not email the email address in the video, this was for the live viewing only. If you have any queries, please email the CEDA helpdesk </span></p>
