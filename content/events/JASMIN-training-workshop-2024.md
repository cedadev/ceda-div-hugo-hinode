On Thursday 28th November 09:00-15:30 BST We will be running a JASMIN training workshop, aimed at new and intermediate users.

This virtual event is a 1-day, hands-on, beginners training workshop for users of JASMIN. It is aimed at novice to intermediate users who wish to further their JASMIN knowledge.

Attendees will participate in a range of hands-on task-based exercises that will increase familiarity with the JASMIN environment and teach best practice.

The resources {{< link "https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-workshop" >}} are freely available here on GitHub. {{< /link >}} The virtual workshop consists of self-guided time for working through the exercises at your own pace, alongside real-time support and interaction with the JASMIN experts. The exercises covered in this workshop are:

ex01 – Connecting to JASMIN
ex02 – Interactive computing using a sci server
ex03 – Transferring and sharing data
ex04 – Extracting a variable from a file in the CEDA Archive
ex05 – Batch computing – running a script on LOTUS
ex09 – Using Jupyter Notebooks on JASMIN
