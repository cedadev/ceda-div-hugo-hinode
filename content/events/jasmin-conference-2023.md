We will be hosting the next JASMIN conference at our host institute on the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire. It will occur over two half days on the afternoon of Wednesday 1 and the morning of Thursday 2 November 2023.

Itâ€™s been a long time since we last ran an in-person conference. Lots has changed with JASMIN and within the user community since then. Now is the perfect time to get everyone together again, share recent experiences, updates and changes, whilst strengthening the user community and discussing the future.

The purpose of the conference is to: 

Strengthen the community and enable sharing of experience and expertise

Get some feedback from users and provide an opportunity to discuss the feedback 

Discuss the question: where does the community want us to go in the future? 

In previous years, the JASMIN user conference has been a 1 or 2 day event - usually in person, at the Harwell Campus. It has consisted of a mixture of science talks from users, update presentations from the JASMIN team, breakout discussions and networking time. 

This year will be similar, but we intend to run some of the programme in a hybrid format. We also intend to host online science seminars ahead of the conference, which will allow more time during the conference for discussion and networking. We hope that by offering part-hybrid sessions, separate science talks and adequate time for travel will ensure the conference is as accessible and as useful as possible to a large proportion of our user community. 

If you are interested in hearing more about how JASMIN can support your research, then this is a great opportunity to learn more, meet the team and other members of the user community. 

Please save the date - further details will be shared in due course.
