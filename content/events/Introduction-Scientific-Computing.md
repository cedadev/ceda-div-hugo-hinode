There is an online introduction to bash shell (Unix/Linux) on October 30th. 13-15th November is the introduction to Python programming. 15-17th November is working with data & Introduction to Git/GitHub.
The course is taught as a series of hands-on workshops. Students may register for the whole course as a package, or individual modules to suit their own learning needs.

We aim to equip students with fundamental knowledge and build the skills that are essential for almost all researchers in modern scientific disciplines. Each topic will be introduced and students will then apply their learning by working through practical exercises, supported by the trainers. The course is highly interactive â€“ students are encouraged to ask questions and request support as needed.
