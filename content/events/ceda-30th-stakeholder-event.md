Join us for a special event marking 30 years of the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis! Over the past three decades, we’ve been dedicated to providing data and information services for environmental science through world-class data curation services, flexible technologies for data analysis and our contributions to national and international communities.

At this event we will celebrate the past 30 years of innovation, growth, and collaboration at CEDA, showcase the depth and breadth of the work currently we do, and gather your feedback and ideas to shape the next 30 years.

If you would be interested in attending and finding out more about the work we do at CEDA, please fill out this {{< link "https://engagementhub.ukri.org/stfc-ralspace/copy-of-celebrating-30-years-of-ceda-help-us-imagi" >}} **expression of interest form** {{< /link >}}. We will contact you by 8th November to confirm if you have a place at the event. Unfortunately we will be unable to offer everyone a place at the event due to limited capacity.

We look forward to celebrating with you and envisioning the next chapter of CEDA’s legacy!
