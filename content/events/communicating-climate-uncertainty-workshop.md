description: A workshop to discuss how to communicate uncertainties in climate information.

On November 30, CEDA staff and the Climateurope2 project are organizing a workshop on Uncertainty to discuss how users of climate information deal with uncertainties and how providers of climate services should communicate about uncertainties in ways that enable users to extract the information they need. This workshop is intended for anyone involved in the practice of climate services and dealing with communicating uncertainties, or simply interested in this topic.

During the morning session, the speakers will present different perspectives on climate uncertainty communication:

- National climate forecast perspective: Janette Bessembinder, KNMI
- Concept of risk as uncertainty: Andreas Hafver, DNV
- Decision making on different timescales of climate uncertainty: Christopher Jack, Red Cross

Following the presentations, there will be a panel discussion including:

- Janette Bessembinder, KNMI
- Christopher Jack, Red Cross
- Gwendoline Lacressonniere, Ramboll
- Siegfried Eisinger, DNV

In the afternoon, there will be a forum for participant discussions aimed at collecting examples of communicating climate uncertainty and use cases illustrating how climate services can support climate-informed decisions.
