- title: Development of Geophysical Data Facility (GDF) Begins
  icon: fas rocket
  color: primary
  date: 1984-07-01
  content:
    An Advisory Panel (of representatives from a wide range of interested institutions and universities) is set up to oversee the development of the Geophysical Data Facility (GDF) and a number of pilot studies are being undertaken. 
    The GDF is to be set-up to organise and provide access to data from many Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Geophysical experiments in the Middle Atmosphere, Climate, Solar Terrestrial and Planetary research.

  date: 1985-08-01
  content:
    The GDF main aim is to facilitate data exchange to ease the problem of magnetic tape handling which is becoming a severe burden. 
    During the year, data from the NIMBUS series of satellites and Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer (AMPTE) have been consolidated into databases on the IBM central computer. 
    These include measured values of temperature of the middle atmosphere and of density, temperature, pressure and energy spectra of electrons and ions in the magnetosphere.
    A user at a remote site can access catalogues of the data holdings, select data of interest and transfer these to his own installation via JANET.

  content:
    The general interface to the GDF is improved considerably primarily to help and encourage users. 
    By providing cross links to other geophysical datasets at RAL, datasets from different sources can be readily combined. High level command instructions and graph plotting routines are now also available to aid data manipulation.

  content:
    Data now available from the GDF include ground-based and satellite observations from the UK and abroad as well as modelling results from intercomparison and testing measurements. 
    The datasets now include in-situ space plasma data from AMPTE and stratospheric results from SAMS (Stratospheric And Mesospheric Sounder), LIMS and SSU (Stratospheric Sounder Unit) and output from thermospheric and atmospheric models. 
    Solar terrestrial data from the World Data Centre at RAL are also accessible through the GDF environment.

- title: NERC Met Office Data Agreement 
  icon: fa-regular fa-handshake
  color: primary
  date: 1996-10-01
  content:
    A formal agreement was reached between the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Met Office in which all future requests to the Met Office for data intended for NERC-funded atmospheric research will be coordinated by the BADC. 
    This arrangement avoids duplicate requests for data. 
    A strategy of bulk purchasing is in place, benefiting the wider research community in the long term. The BADC pro-actively organises the bulk acquisition of popular datasets. Examples include ECMWF model analyses and Met Office upper-air and surface data.
